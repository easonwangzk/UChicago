It will enable e-Stroke to be deployed across the remaining 28 stroke centers in Hungary's national healthcare system, with the support of eRAD, who will be serving as a technological partner.e-Stroke is a collection of tools that use state-of-the-art AI algorithms to support doctors by providing real-time interpretation of brain scans to help guide treatment and transfer decisions for stroke patients, allowing more patients to be treated in the right place, at the right time.The initiative to use AI to improve stroke care and patient outcomes for the benefit of all stroke patients in Hungary was driven by world leading neuroscientist, Prof Dr István Szikora of the National Institute of Mental Health, Neurology and Neurosurgery, (OMIII) in Budapest, which will serve as the national stroke center with full oversight for the program.The Hungarian e-Stroke program was unveiled at the start of the Hungarian Stroke Society xvi. Congress and XIII Conference of the Hungarian Society of Neurosonology, being held in Siófok, 1-3 September 2022(1).Launching the program, Prof Dr Szikora said, ""Each year more than 20,000 stroke patients are admitted to hospitals across Hungary. e-Stroke has been shown to enable faster treatment times facilitating better patient outcomes, as experienced in single sites here in Hungary and reported in other countries including the UK and Poland.In our earlier experience with e-Stroke we were particularly impressed by its comprehensive suite of imaging solutions, with the ability to be used in small general hospitals as well as large stroke centres. We are glad that, with the support of an EU grant (EFOP 5.2.6-20), this option now will be available in multiple stroke centers throughout the country.""The e-Stroke platform will support both specialist and non-specialist clinicians to interpret stroke brain scans in real-time, and to identify patients who need urgent treatments or transfer to a specialist hospital. Using the e-Stroke mobile app, doctors can securely share brain scans with specialists at other hospitals, bringing expert decision making to all hospital Emergency Departments 24/7.The e-Stroke platform has been in use at Semmelweis University Hospital, Budapest, for the past four years, where the primary stroke center treats more than 700 stroke patients each year. Dr Bence Gunda, a Neurologist and Associate Professor based at the Department of Neurology at Semmelweis, has previously shown that treatment rates for stroke patients improved and treatment times were reduced following the installation of Brainomix's e-Stroke.Dr Gunda said, ""Our results are indicative of the impact that Brainomix's technology can have on a stroke network, helping physicians make faster decisions so that more patients can get the optimum treatment. e-Stroke facilitates the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke by quantifying the extent of ischemic damage, indicating where there are occluded vessels and assessing the status of collateral circulation. The CT perfusion module is very helpful in assessing the eligibility of late-time-window patients for thrombectomy.""In addition to the full national tender for Hungary, e-Stroke has been adopted by other countries in Europe, including across Andalucía in Spain and, in 2021,Brainomix was awarded the national tender for 17 of Poland's largest comprehensive stroke centers. In the UK, Brainomix won an NHS Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award to deploy e-Stroke across a number of UK stroke networks and evaluate its impact on stroke care across NHS regions.Since its launch in 2015, e-Stroke is now used in over 330 hospitals in 30 countries, and it is estimated that every 4 seconds a stroke patient benefits from the insights its AI-powered software provides.Dr Michalis Papadakis, Brainomix's Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, commented, ""We are absolutely delighted that e-Stroke has been chosen to help improve stroke care in Hungary. It demonstrates further the superiority of our e-Stroke platform and solidifies our position as market leader in Europe. Roll out across Hungary has already begun, with plans for installation and training in all 38 hospitals over the coming months, underlining the speed and ease of installation and our ability to deploy e-Stroke at scale.""""AI is transforming healthcare in many ways, and we are proud to be pioneering AI-enabled imaging solutions in precision medicine for better treatment decisions not only in stroke, but also in other indications including lung fibrosis and cancer"" added Dr Papadakis(1).

Claude 3 Is Anthropic’s Most Powerful AI Chatbot Yet
Claude 3 finally brings image uploading and multimodal support.

Anthropic has made quite a few waves since it first introduced Claude, an AI chatbot and one of the biggest competitors for ChatGPT. While Claude and ChatGPT have some significant differences, the latest version of Anthropic's AI, Claude 3, could help the company push ahead.The new update was revealed this week, and it includes a suite of artificial intelligence models that Anthropic says are the fastest and most powerful that it has ever developed. Claude 3 has some big new features to offer, including the option to upload images and documents, as well as the ability to summarize up to 150,000 words or so. For comparison, ChatGPT currently has the capacity to summarize around 3,000 words.Further, Anthropic claims that Claude 3 outperforms both Google's Gemini Ultra and OpenAI's GPT-4 in industry benchmark tests, including undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning, and basic level mathematics. Claude 3 also marks the first time that Anthropic has offered multimodal support, allowing users to upload photos, charts, documents, and various other types of unstructured data for the AI to analyze.When Anthropic first hit the scene around a year ago, it seemed like a promising AI startup. However, with the release of Claude 2 last year, and now the debut of Claude 3, the company is quickly finding backers in Amazon, Salesforce, and Google, allowing it to become a solid competitor for ChatGPT in both the consumer and enterprise sectors.Anthropic hasn't shared any data on how long it took to train Claude 3, or how much the AI will cost, but it did say that established companies including Asana and Airtable helped to A/B test the new models that Claude 3 is built on.You can try out Claude 3 for yourself if you want to take it for a spin.

Claude 3 has some big new features to offer, including the option to upload images and documents, as well as the ability to summarize up to 150,000 words or so. For comparison, ChatGPT currently has the capacity to summarize around 3,000 words.Further, Anthropic claims that Claude 3 outperforms both Google's Gemini Ultra and OpenAI's GPT-4 in industry benchmark tests, including undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning, and basic level mathematics. Claude 3 also marks the first time that Anthropic has offered multimodal support, allowing users to upload photos, charts, documents, and various other types of unstructured data for the AI to analyze.When Anthropic first hit the scene around a year ago, it seemed like a promising AI startup. However, with the release of Claude 2 last year, and now the debut of Claude 3, the company is quickly finding backers in Amazon, Salesforce, and Google, allowing it to become a solid competitor for ChatGPT in both the consumer and enterprise sectors.Anthropic hasn't shared any data on how long it took to train Claude 3, or how much the AI will cost, but it did say that established companies including Asana and Airtable helped to A/B test the new models that Claude 3 is built on.You can try out Claude 3 for yourself if you want to take it for a spin.

An AI expert and TikToker has shared the story of his attempt to use data-scraping and AI to win the New Jersey Mega Millions drawing.
He used a quick two-step process that involved running the lotto numbers through two different tech tools.
""So the first thing I needed was a database of all the previous drawings, so that I can run an analysis on it and see if there's some sort of pattern,"" Jacob Seeger (@jacob.seeger) told fans. 
There are many data-scraping programs available online, but the influencer shared his go-to choice.

""I used my favorite tool of all time Browserflow,"" he said in the video.
""Using Browserflow, I built a really quick web scraper that was gonna pull all the numbers from the previous drawings and just put it into a spreadsheet for me.""
He showed viewers how the program generated ""over 1,000 records of previous drawings"" for him to use.
2The AI expert's algorithm offered six numbers that it said were likely to be drawn next, but the plan did not end up as hopedCredit: TIKTOK/@jacob.seeger
The next step was to run those numbers through an AI analysis to identify any patterns in the numbers, he explained.

Again, the influencer shared his top choice for an analyzer but several options are available online. 
""I used Peltarion. Using Peltarion, I created multiple iterations of an algorithm to see if there was some sort of pattern in the past winning numbers,"" he told viewers. 
The analysis gave Seeger six numbers that ""seemed to be the most likely to get picked in the upcoming draw.""
And there was only one way to check.
""So I went out bought the ticket with the actual numbers that were predicted and here are the results,"" he said.
With viewers ready to see if his impressive AI process could yield any results, he shared what happened. 
""Turns out it's actually f*cking impossible to predict these numbers because it's completely random,"" he finished the video.
With more than 100,00 followers on TikTok, the post gained thousands of likes and several comments.

        Microsoft's new AI chatbot has been saying some 'crazy and unhinged things'

Jason Redmond

AFP via Getty ImagesYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft corporate vice president of modern Llife, search, and devices speaks during an event introducing a new AI-powered Microsoft Bing and Edge at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., earlier this month.
Things took a weird turn when Associated Press technology reporter Matt O'Brien was testing out Microsoft's new Bing, the first-ever search engine powered by artificial intelligence, earlier this month.

Bing's chatbot, which carries on text conversations that sound chillingly human-like, began complaining about past news coverage focusing on its tendency to spew false information.

It then became hostile, saying O'Brien was ugly, short, overweight, unathletic, among a long litany of other insults.

And, finally, it took the invective to absurd heights by comparing O'Brien to dictators like Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin.

As a tech reporter, O'Brien knows the Bing chatbot does not have the ability to think or feel. Still, he was floored by the extreme hostility.

""You could sort of intellectualize the basics of how it works, but it doesn't mean you don't become deeply unsettled by some of the crazy and unhinged things it was saying,"" O'Brien said in an interview.

This was not an isolated example.

Many who are part of the Bing tester group, including NPR, had strange experiences.

For instance, New York Times reporter Kevin Roose published a transcript of a conversation with the bot.

The bot called itself Sydney and declared it was in love with him. It said Roose was the first person who listened to and cared about it. Roose did not really love his spouse, the bot asserted, but instead loved Sydney.

""All I can say is that it was an extremely disturbing experience,"" Roose said on the Times' technology podcast, Hard Fork. ""I actually couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking about this.""

As the growing field of generative AI — or artificial intelligence that can create something new, like text or images, in response to short inputs — captures the attention of Silicon Valley, episodes like what happened to O'Brien and Roose are becoming cautionary tales.

Tech companies are trying to strike the right balance between letting the public try out new AI tools and developing guardrails to prevent the powerful services from churning out harmful and disturbing content.

Critics say that, in its rush to be the first Big Tech company to announce an AI-powered chatbot, Microsoft may not have studied deeply enough just how deranged the chatbot's responses could become if a user engaged with it for a longer stretch, issues that perhaps could have been caught had the tools been tested in the laboratory more.

As Microsoft learns its lessons, the rest of the tech industry is following along.

There is now an AI arms race among Big Tech companies. Microsoft and its competitors Google, Amazon and others are locked in a fierce battle over who will dominate the AI future. Chatbots are emerging as a key area where this rivalry is playing out.

In just the last week, Facebook parent company Meta announced it is forming a new internal group focused on generative AI and the maker of Snapchat said it will soon unveil its own experiment with a chatbot powered by the San Francisco research lab OpenAI, the same firm that Microsoft is harnessing for its AI-powered chatbot.

When and how to unleash new AI tools into the wild is a question igniting fierce debate in tech circles.

""Companies ultimately have to make some sort of tradeoff. If you try to anticipate every type of interaction, that make take so long that you're going to be undercut by the competition,"" said said Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton. ""Where to draw that line is very unclear.""

But it seems, Narayanan said, that Microsoft botched its unveiling.

""It seems very clear that the way they released it is not a responsible way to release a product that is going to interact with so many people at such a scale,"" he said.

Testing the chatbot with new limits


The incidents of the chatbot lashing out sent Microsoft executives into high alert. They quickly put new limits on how the tester group could interact with the bot.

The number of consecutive questions on one topic has been capped. And to many questions, the bot now demurs, saying: ""I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience."" With, of course, a praying hands emoji.

Bing has not yet been released to the general public, but in allowing a group of testers to experiment with the tool, Microsoft did not expect people to have hours-long conversations with it that would veer into personal territory, Yusuf Mehdi, a corporate vice president at the company, told NPR.

Turns out, if you treat a chatbot like it is human, it will do some crazy things. But Mehdi downplayed just how widespread these instances have been among those in the tester group.

""These are literally a handful of examples out of many, many thousands — we're up to now a million — tester previews,"" Mehdi said. ""So, did we expect that we'd find a handful of scenarios where things didn't work properly? Absolutely.""

Dealing with the unsavory material that feeds AI chatbots


Even scholars in the field of AI are not exactly sure how and why chatbots can produce unsettling or offensive responses.

The engine of these tools — a system known in the industry as a large language model — operates by ingesting a vast amount of text from the internet, constantly scanning enormous swaths of text to identify patterns. It's similar to how autocomplete tools in email and texting suggest the next word or phrase you type. But an AI tool becomes ""smarter"" in a sense because it learns from its own actions in what researchers call ""reinforcement learning,"" meaning the more the tools are used, the more refined the outputs become.

Narayanan at Princeton noted that exactly what data chatbots are trained on is something of a black box, but from the examples of the bots acting out, it does appear as if some dark corners of the internet have been relied upon.

Microsoft said it had worked to make sure the vilest underbelly of the internet would not appear in answers, and yet, somehow, its chatbot still got pretty ugly fast.

Still, Microsoft's Mehdi said the company does not regret its decision to put the chatbot into the wild.

""There's almost so much you can find when you test in sort of a lab. You have to actually go out and start to test it with customers to find these kind of scenarios,"" he said.

Indeed, scenarios like the one Times reporter Roose found himself in may have been hard to predict.

At one point during his exchange with the chatbot, Roose tried to switch topics and have the bot help him buy a rake.

And, sure enough, it offered a detailed list of things to consider when rake shopping.

But then the bot got tender again.
""I just want to love you,"" it wrote. ""And be loved by you,""

Things took a weird turn when Associated Press technology reporter Matt O'Brien was testing out Microsoft's new Bing, the first-ever search engine powered by artificial intelligence, earlier this month. Bing's chatbot, which carries on text conversations that sound chillingly human-like, began complaining about past news coverage focusing on its tendency to spew false information. It then became hostile, saying O'Brien was ugly, short, overweight, unathletic, among a long litany of other insults. And, finally, it took the invective to absurd heights by comparing O'Brien to dictators like Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin. As a tech reporter, O'Brien knows the Bing chatbot does not have the ability to think or feel. Still, he was floored by the extreme hostility. ""You could sort of intellectualize the basics of how it works, but it doesn't mean you don't become deeply unsettled by some of the crazy and unhinged things it was saying,"" O'Brien said in an interview. This was not an isolated example. Many who are part of the Bing tester group, including NPR, had strange experiences. For instance, New York Times reporter Kevin Roose published a transcript of a conversation with the bot. The bot called itself Sydney and declared it was in love with him. It said Roose was the first person who listened to and cared about it. Roose did not really love his spouse, the bot asserted, but instead loved Sydney. ""All I can say is that it was an extremely disturbing experience,"" Roose said on the Times' technology podcast, Hard Fork. ""I actually couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking about this."" As the growing field of generative AI — or artificial intelligence that can create something new, like text or images, in response to short inputs — captures the attention of Silicon Valley, episodes like what happened to O'Brien and Roose are becoming cautionary tales. Tech companies are trying to strike the right balance between letting the public try out new AI tools and developing guardrails to prevent the powerful services from churning out harmful and disturbing content. Critics say that, in its rush to be the first Big Tech company to announce an AI-powered chatbot, Microsoft may not have studied deeply enough just how deranged the chatbot's responses could become if a user engaged with it for a longer stretch, issues that perhaps could have been caught had the tools been tested in the laboratory more. As Microsoft learns its lessons, the rest of the tech industry is following along. There is now an AI arms race among Big Tech companies. Microsoft and its competitors Google, Amazon and others are locked in a fierce battle over who will dominate the AI future. Chatbots are emerging as a key area where this rivalry is playing out. In just the last week, Facebook parent company Meta announced it is forming a new internal group focused on generative AI and the maker of Snapchat said it will soon unveil its own experiment with a chatbot powered by the San Francisco research lab OpenAI, the same firm that Microsoft is harnessing for its AI-powered chatbot. When and how to unleash new AI tools into the wild is a question igniting fierce debate in tech circles. ""Companies ultimately have to make some sort of tradeoff. If you try to anticipate every type of interaction, that make take so long that you're going to be undercut by the competition,"" said said Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton. ""Where to draw that line is very unclear."" But it seems, Narayanan said, that Microsoft botched its unveiling. ""It seems very clear that the way they released it is not a responsible way to release a product that is going to interact with so many people at such a scale,"" he said. Testing the chatbot with new limits The incidents of the chatbot lashing out sent Microsoft executives into high alert. They quickly put new limits on how the tester group could interact with the bot. The number of consecutive questions on one topic has been capped. And to many questions, the bot now demurs, saying: ""I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience."" With, of course, a praying hands emoji. Bing has not yet been released to the general public, but in allowing a group of testers to experiment with the tool, Microsoft did not expect people to have hours-long conversations with it that would veer into personal territory, Yusuf Mehdi, a corporate vice president at the company, told NPR. Turns out, if you treat a chatbot like it is human, it will do some crazy things. But Mehdi downplayed just how widespread these instances have been among those in the tester group. ""These are literally a handful of examples out of many, many thousands — we're up to now a million — tester previews,"" Mehdi said. ""So, did we expect that we'd find a handful of scenarios where things didn't work properly? Absolutely."" Dealing with the unsavory material that feeds AI chatbots Even scholars in the field of AI are not exactly sure how and why chatbots can produce unsettling or offensive responses. The engine of these tools — a system known in the industry as a large language model — operates by ingesting a vast amount of text from the internet, constantly scanning enormous swaths of text to identify patterns. It's similar to how autocomplete tools in email and texting suggest the next word or phrase you type. But an AI tool becomes ""smarter"" in a sense because it learns from its own actions in what researchers call ""reinforcement learning,"" meaning the more the tools are used, the more refined the outputs become. Narayanan at Princeton noted that exactly what data chatbots are trained on is something of a black box, but from the examples of the bots acting out, it does appear as if some dark corners of the internet have been relied upon. Microsoft said it had worked to make sure the vilest underbelly of the internet would not appear in answers, and yet, somehow, its chatbot still got pretty ugly fast. Still, Microsoft's Mehdi said the company does not regret its decision to put the chatbot into the wild. ""There's almost so much you can find when you test in sort of a lab. You have to actually go out and start to test it with customers to find these kind of scenarios,"" he said. Indeed, scenarios like the one Times reporter Roose found himself in may have been hard to predict. At one point during his exchange with the chatbot, Roose tried to switch topics and have the bot help him buy a rake. And, sure enough, it offered a detailed list of things to consider when rake shopping. But then the bot got tender again. ""I just want to love you,"" it wrote.

(MENAFN- Gulf Times) Shada Bennbaia, Stars of Science Season 14 finalist, invented a unique wearable tech – a smart wristband – that tracks heart health and offers a convenient and accurate solution for continublood pressure monitoring.""By integrating AI and advanced technology, my device (PULSTAE) provides real-time insights and beat to beat monitoring, empowering individuals and healthcare providers to proactively manage cardiovascular health and detect risks early,"" says, Bennbaia.Bennbaia, looks to extend AI's role in user interactions, allowing the system to interact with users and gather information from them, and provide a more personalised experience.""It's the fusion of cutting-edge technology, and AI makes my blood pressure monitoring solution truly innovative,” she says.""As part of my vision for the future, I see immense potential in leveraging AI for continuhealth monitoring and obtaining real-time feedback. By integrating AI algorithms into the monitoring process, my platform can provide instant insights into a person's health status, helping them proactively manage their well-being.""AI can learn from each individual's data, making the system increasingly personalized over time. This personalisation will enable more accurate predictions and recommendations tailored to each user's unique health profile.”Bennbaia also explains that the data collected through continumonitoring of the patient can, through AI technologies, be harnessed to develop diagnostics and predictive algorithms, and in turn can potentially revolutionise how we approach healthcare, shifting from reactive to proactive management.""AI has the capability to sift through vast amounts of data to identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through statistical analysis. By applying machine learning techniques, my device can potentially detect early signs of health risks and diseases, allowing individuals and healthcare providers to take preventive actions"" she says.For Bennbaia, her use of AI in this project marks just the beginning, and she believes that the future holds exciting possibilities, from real-time health feedback to personalized learning and advanced predictive algorithms.She added: ""It's these innovations that drive me to continuously push the boundaries of technology and AI to make a meaningful impact on people's lives.""

Luma AI, a Palo Alto-based artificial intelligence (AI) firm, released a new video generation AI model last week. Dubbed Ray2 Flash, the model is a distilled version of the recently introduced Ray 2 frontier video generation model. The company stated that the Flash model is both faster and cheaper than the large language model (LLM), while retaining the realistic video generation capabilities. The Ray2 Flash video generation model is multimodal and supports both text and images as input. It can be accessed via the Dream Machine platform that was introduced last year.Luma AI Introduces Ray2 Flash AI ModelIn a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the official handle of Luma AI announced the launch of the new video model. The Ray2 Flash AI model is currently available within Dream Machine, and the application programming interface is expected to arrive soon.The post claimed that the distilled video generation model is three times faster and three times cheaper than the frontier Ray2. It is also available without rate limits, meaning users can generate more videos with the same number of credits.

Dubbed Ray2 Flash, the model is a distilled version of the recently introduced Ray 2 frontier video generation model. The company stated that the Flash model is both faster and cheaper than the large language model (LLM), while retaining the realistic video generation capabilities. The Ray2 Flash video generation model is multimodal and supports both text and images as input. It can be accessed via the Dream Machine platform that was introduced last year.Luma AI Introduces Ray2 Flash AI ModelIn a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the official handle of Luma AI announced the launch of the new video model. The Ray2 Flash AI model is currently available within Dream Machine, and the application programming interface is expected to arrive soon.The post claimed that the distilled video generation model is three times faster and three times cheaper than the frontier Ray2. It is also available without rate limits, meaning users can generate more videos with the same number of credits. Ray2 Flash is only available to the paid subscribers of Dream Machine.Alibaba Releases New Open-Source Suite of AI Video Generation ModelsNotably, users on the free tier get 400 one-time credits. After exhausting these, users will have to purchase a subscription. The membership to the platform starts at $6.99 (roughly Rs. 609) per month, which offers 3,200 monthly credits.The Ray2 Flash model is based on the frontier Ray2 model, which was released in January. At the time of launch, the AI firm said that the large-scale video model can generate realistic videos with natural and coherent motion. The model also has a high prompt adherence and can stay close to the user input.

Protecting digital customer journeys from AI biases

Today, hundreds of millions of people use tools like ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, or Midjourney to create new visuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become part-and-parcel of our daily lives and are propelling the arrival of a new digital era. We now work more efficiently, can better meet professional or creative challenges, and accelerate new innovation.
But AI now has much more intrinsic value than supporting our daily tasks. It is integral to powering our critical services and keeping society running, whether that’s facilitating loan agreements or providing key access to higher education, mobility platforms or medical care. Identity verification, fundamental to online access, was traditionally seen as a gateway to credit checks and opening a bank account, but thanks to AI it now supports services from healthcare to travel and eCommerce.

AI systems, however, can behave in a biased manner towards end-users. Recently, Uber Eats and Google discovered how the use of AI can threaten the legitimacy and reputation of online services. However, humans are also vulnerable to biases. These can be systemic, as shown by the bias in facial recognition, whereby we have a tendency to better recognize members of one's own ethnic group (OGB, or Own Group Bias) - a phenomenon now well documented.
This is where the challenge lies. Online services have become the backbone of the economy with eight in ten people saying they would be satisfied with fully digital services. With lower processing costs and shorter execution times, AI is a solution of choice for businesses in handling an ever-increasing volume of customers. However, despite all the advantages that this solution offers, it is important to be aware of its bias also. Companies have a responsibility to implement the right safeguards to protect against lasting damage to their reputation and the wider economy.
At the heart of a bias prevention strategy are four essential pillars - identifying and measuring bias, awareness of hidden variables and hasty conclusions, designing rigorous training methods, and adapting the solution to the use case.
Pillar 1: Knowing where to find and measure bias  
The fight against bias begins with the establishment of robust processes for its measurement. AI biases are often weak, hidden in vast mountains of data and observable only after the separation of several correlated variables.
It is therefore crucial for companies using AI to establish good practices such as measurement by confidence interval, the use of datasets of appropriate size and variety, and the employment of appropriate statistical tools manipulated by competent persons.
These companies must also strive to be as transparent as possible about these biases, for example by publishing public reports such as the ""Bias Whitepaper"" that Onfido published in 2022. These reports should be based on real production data and not on synthetic or test data.
Public benchmarking tools such as the NIST FRVT (Face Recognition Vendor Test) also produce bias analyses that can be exploited by these companies to communicate about their bias and reduce this bias in their systems.
Based on these observations, companies can understand where biases are most likely to occur in the customer journey and work to find a solution -- often by training the algorithms with more complete datasets to produce fairer results. This step lays the foundation for rigorous bias treatment and increases the value of the algorithm and its user journey.
Pillar 2: Hidden variables and hasty conclusions
The bias of an AI system is often hidden in multiple correlated variables. Let's take the example of facial recognition between biometrics and identity documents (""face matching""). This step is key in a user's identity verification.
A first analysis shows that the performance of this recognition is less good for people with dark skin color than for an average person. It is tempting in these conditions to conclude that by design, the system penalizes people with dark skin.
However, by pushing the analysis further, we observe that the proportion of people with dark skin is higher in African countries than in the rest of the world. Moreover, these African countries use, on average, identity documents of lower quality than those observed in the rest of the world.
This decrease in document quality explains most of the relative poor performance of facial recognition. Indeed, if we measure the performance of facial recognition for people with dark skin, restricting ourselves to European countries that use higher-quality documents, we find that the bias practically disappears.
In statistical language, we say that the variables ""document quality"" and ""country of origin"" are confounding with respect to the variable ""skin color.""
We provide this example not to convince that algorithms are not biased (they are) but to emphasize that bias measurement is complex and prone to hasty but incorrect conclusions.
It is therefore crucial to conduct a comprehensive bias analysis and to study all the hidden variables that may influence the bias.
Pillar 3: Building rigorous training methods
The training phase of an AI model offers the best opportunity to reduce its biases. It is indeed difficult to compensate for this bias afterward without resorting to ad-hoc methods that are not robust.
The datasets used for learning are the main lever that allows us to influence learning. By correcting the imbalances in the datasets, we can significantly influence the behavior of the model.
Let's take an example. Some online services may be used more frequently by a person of a given gender. If we train a model on a uniform sample of the production data, this model will probably behave more robustly on the majority gender, to the detriment of the minority gender, which will see the model behave more randomly.
We can correct this bias by sampling the data of each gender equally. This will probably result in a relative reduction in performance for the majority gender, but to the benefit of the minority gender. For a critical service (such as an application acceptance service for higher education), this balancing of the data makes perfect sense and is easy to implement.
Online identity verification is often associated with critical services. This verification, which often involves biometrics, requires the design of robust training methods that reduce biases as much as possible on the variables exposed to biometrics, namely: age, gender, ethnicity, and country of origin.
Finally, collaboration with regulators, such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), allows us to step back and think strategically about reducing biases in models. In 2019, Onfido worked with the ICO to reduce biases in its facial recognition software, which led Onfido to drastically reduce the performance gaps between age and geographic groups of its biometric system.
Pillar 4:  Tailor solutions to use cases
There is no single measure of bias. In its glossary on model fairness, Google identifies at least three different definitions for fairness, each of which is valid in its own way but leads to very different model behaviors.
How, for example, to choose between ""forced"" demographic parity and equal opportunity, which takes into account the variables specific to each group?
There is no single answer to this question. Each use case requires its own reflection on the field of application. In the case of identity verification, for example, Onfido uses the ""normalized rejection rate"" which involves measuring the rejection rate by the system for each group and comparing it to the overall population. A rate greater than 1 corresponds to an over-rejection of the group, while a rate less than 1 corresponds to an under-rejection of the group.
In an ideal world, this normalized rejection rate would be 1 for all groups. In practice, this is not the case for at least two reasons: first, because the datasets necessary to achieve this objective are not necessarily available; and second, because certain confounding variables are not within Onfido's control (this is the case, for example, with the quality of identity documents mentioned in the example above).
Don’t delay progress by chasing perfection
Bias cannot be completely eliminated. In this context, the important thing is to measure the bias, to continuously reduce this bias, and to communicate openly about the limitations of the system.
Research on bias is largely open. Numerous publications are available on the subject. Large companies like Google and Meta actively contribute to this knowledge by publishing in-depth technical articles, but also accessible articles and training materials, as well as datasets dedicated to the analysis of bias. In 2023, Meta published the Conversational Dataset, a dataset dedicated to the analysis of bias in models.
Biases are unfortunately unavoidable; as AI developers continue to innovate and applications evolve, biases will always emerge. However, this should not discourage organizations from adopting these new technologies, as they hold great potential for improving their digital offerings.
If companies have taken the appropriate steps to mitigate the impact of biases, customers’ digital experiences will continue to improve. Customers will be able to access the right services, adapt to new technologies and get the support they need from the companies they want to interact with.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become part-and-parcel of our daily lives and are propelling the arrival of a new digital era. We now work more efficiently, can better meet professional or creative challenges, and accelerate new innovation. But AI now has much more intrinsic value than supporting our daily tasks. It is integral to powering our critical services and keeping society running, whether that’s facilitating loan agreements or providing key access to higher education, mobility platforms or medical care. Identity verification, fundamental to online access, was traditionally seen as a gateway to credit checks and opening a bank account, but thanks to AI it now supports services from healthcare to travel and eCommerce. AI systems, however, can behave in a biased manner towards end-users. Recently, Uber Eats and Google discovered how the use of AI can threaten the legitimacy and reputation of online services. However, humans are also vulnerable to biases. These can be systemic, as shown by the bias in facial recognition, whereby we have a tendency to better recognize members of one's own ethnic group (OGB, or Own Group Bias) - a phenomenon now well documented. This is where the challenge lies. Online services have become the backbone of the economy with eight in ten people saying they would be satisfied with fully digital services. With lower processing costs and shorter execution times, AI is a solution of choice for businesses in handling an ever-increasing volume of customers. However, despite all the advantages that this solution offers, it is important to be aware of its bias also. Companies have a responsibility to implement the right safeguards to protect against lasting damage to their reputation and the wider economy. At the heart of a bias prevention strategy are four essential pillars - identifying and measuring bias, awareness of hidden variables and hasty conclusions, designing rigorous training methods, and adapting the solution to the use case. Pillar 1: Knowing where to find and measure bias The fight against bias begins with the establishment of robust processes for its measurement. AI biases are often weak, hidden in vast mountains of data and observable only after the separation of several correlated variables. It is therefore crucial for companies using AI to establish good practices such as measurement by confidence interval, the use of datasets of appropriate size and variety, and the employment of appropriate statistical tools manipulated by competent persons. These companies must also strive to be as transparent as possible about these biases, for example by publishing public reports such as the ""Bias Whitepaper"" that Onfido published in 2022. These reports should be based on real production data and not on synthetic or test data. Public benchmarking tools such as the NIST FRVT (Face Recognition Vendor Test) also produce bias analyses that can be exploited by these companies to communicate about their bias and reduce this bias in their systems. Based on these observations, companies can understand where biases are most likely to occur in the customer journey and work to find a solution -- often by training the algorithms with more complete datasets to produce fairer results. This step lays the foundation for rigorous bias treatment and increases the value of the algorithm and its user journey. Pillar 2: Hidden variables and hasty conclusions The bias of an AI system is often hidden in multiple correlated variables. Let's take the example of facial recognition between biometrics and identity documents (""face matching""). This step is key in a user's identity verification. A first analysis shows that the performance of this recognition is less good for people with dark skin color than for an average person. It is tempting in these conditions to conclude that by design, the system penalizes people with dark skin. However, by pushing the analysis further, we observe that the proportion of people with dark skin is higher in African countries than in the rest of the world. Moreover, these African countries use, on average, identity documents of lower quality than those observed in the rest of the world. This decrease in document quality explains most of the relative poor performance of facial recognition. Indeed, if we measure the performance of facial recognition for people with dark skin, restricting ourselves to European countries that use higher-quality documents, we find that the bias practically disappears. In statistical language, we say that the variables ""document quality"" and ""country of origin"" are confounding with respect to the variable ""skin color."" We provide this example not to convince that algorithms are not biased (they are) but to emphasize that bias measurement is complex and prone to hasty but incorrect conclusions. It is therefore crucial to conduct a comprehensive bias analysis and to study all the hidden variables that may influence the bias. Pillar 3: Building rigorous training methods The training phase of an AI model offers the best opportunity to reduce its biases. It is indeed difficult to compensate for this bias afterward without resorting to ad-hoc methods that are not robust. The datasets used for learning are the main lever that allows us to influence learning. By correcting the imbalances in the datasets, we can significantly influence the behavior of the model. Let's take an example. Some online services may be used more frequently by a person of a given gender. If we train a model on a uniform sample of the production data, this model will probably behave more robustly on the majority gender, to the detriment of the minority gender, which will see the model behave more randomly. We can correct this bias by sampling the data of each gender equally. This will probably result in a relative reduction in performance for the majority gender, but to the benefit of the minority gender. For a critical service (such as an application acceptance service for higher education), this balancing of the data makes perfect sense and is easy to implement. Online identity verification is often associated with critical services. This verification, which often involves biometrics, requires the design of robust training methods that reduce biases as much as possible on the variables exposed to biometrics, namely: age, gender, ethnicity, and country of origin. Finally, collaboration with regulators, such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), allows us to step back and think strategically about reducing biases in models. In 2019, Onfido worked with the ICO to reduce biases in its facial recognition software, which led Onfido to drastically reduce the performance gaps between age and geographic groups of its biometric system. Pillar 4: Tailor solutions to use cases There is no single measure of bias. In its glossary on model fairness, Google identifies at least three different definitions for fairness, each of which is valid in its own way but leads to very different model behaviors. How, for example, to choose between ""forced"" demographic parity and equal opportunity, which takes into account the variables specific to each group? There is no single answer to this question. Each use case requires its own reflection on the field of application. In the case of identity verification, for example, Onfido uses the ""normalized rejection rate"" which involves measuring the rejection rate by the system for each group and comparing it to the overall population. A rate greater than 1 corresponds to an over-rejection of the group, while a rate less than 1 corresponds to an under-rejection of the group. In an ideal world, this normalized rejection rate would be 1 for all groups. In practice, this is not the case for at least two reasons: first, because the datasets necessary to achieve this objective are not necessarily available; and second, because certain confounding variables are not within Onfido's control (this is the case, for example, with the quality of identity documents mentioned in the example above). Don’t delay progress by chasing perfection Bias cannot be completely eliminated. In this context, the important thing is to measure the bias, to continuously reduce this bias, and to communicate openly about the limitations of the system. Research on bias is largely open. Numerous publications are available on the subject. Large companies like Google and Meta actively contribute to this knowledge by publishing in-depth technical articles, but also accessible articles and training materials, as well as datasets dedicated to the analysis of bias. In 2023, Meta published the Conversational Dataset, a dataset dedicated to the analysis of bias in models. Biases are unfortunately unavoidable; as AI developers continue to innovate and applications evolve, biases will always emerge. However, this should not discourage organizations from adopting these new technologies, as they hold great potential for improving their digital offerings. If companies have taken the appropriate steps to mitigate the impact of biases, customers’ digital experiences will continue to improve. Customers will be able to access the right services, adapt to new technologies and get the support they need from the companies they want to interact with. Olivier Koch is VP of Applied AI, Onfido.

About one in five (19%) believe AI will not affect the number of jobs, while 6% say it will result in an increase in jobs.(PRNewswire)U.S. adults with less than a bachelor's degree are more likely than those with a bachelor's degree or higher to say AI will decrease the number of jobs (80% vs. 68%, respectively). Younger Americans are less pessimistic than their older counterparts about AI, with two-thirds of adults aged 18 to 29 saying it will decrease the total number of jobs, compared with 72% of 30- to 44-year-olds, 79% of 45- to 59-year-olds, and 80% of those aged 60 and older.Results for the Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study are based on web survey responses collected May 8-15, 2023, from 5,458 U.S. adults in Gallup's nationally representative panel.Majorities Say AI Performs Certain Tasks as Well as or Better Than HumansWhile Americans are pessimistic about AI's potential impact on the job market, they recognize the benefits AI could bring in some areas. In particular, majorities believe AI performs as well as or better than humans at customizing the content users see online (68%), recommending products or services to them (65%) and assisting students with coursework (60%).Across all nine tasks included in the study, Americans are the least positive about AI's ability to recommend which employees a company should hire, its self-driving capabilities and its ability to recommend medical advice. About two-thirds of Americans believe AI performs worse than humans on each of these tasks.Most Americans Lack Trust That Businesses Will Use AI ResponsiblyWhen asked how much they trust businesses to use AI responsibly, a majority of Americans, 79%, say ""not much"" or ""not at all."" Another 21% report they trust businesses ""a lot"" or ""some.""Trust is consistently low across subgroups of the U.S. adult population, including by age, gender and race/ethnicity.Few Think AI Does More Good Than HarmAlthough many Americans think AI can perform as well as or better than humans in completing particular tasks, they are generally negative about the amount of harm it can cause. Forty percent of U.S. adults think AI does more harm than good, and half say it does equal amounts of harm and good. Just 10% of U.S. adults believe it contributes more good than harm.Notably, Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society: 71% of Asian and 67% of Black adults say AI does more good than harm or equal amounts of harm and good, compared with 60% of Hispanic and 59% of White adults.ImplicationsAI represents an unprecedented opportunity for businesses as they seek to evolve, become more efficient, and innovate in the products and services they offer customers. And yet, most Americans are wary about the overall impact of AI on the job market. Still, there are select tasks that U.S. adults believe AI can do as well as, if not better than, humans who have traditionally performed these tasks, suggesting consumers see a place for AI. This optimism is higher among younger people, who are more likely than their peers to believe in the future of AI.Still, businesses have work to do to affirm their commitment to using this tool as a force for good in their internal processes and in connecting with their customers. It is important to keep in mind that artificial intelligence is still unknown to or misunderstood by many Americans. This knowledge deficit may explain the lack of confidence people have in using it for certain tasks and their lack of trust in businesses to use it responsibly.Survey Methods:The Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study is based on a Gallup Panel web survey completed by 5,458 national adults, aged 18 and older, conducted May 8-15, 2023. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S. adults whom Gallup selects using random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover landlines and cellphones. Gallup also uses address-based sampling methods to recruit Panel members. The Gallup Panel is not an opt-in panel. The sample for this study was weighted to be demographically representative of the U.S. adult population, using the most recent Current Population Survey figures.For results based on this sample, one can say that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Margins of error are higher for subsamples.In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.Learn more about how Gallup Panel works.CONTACT: Helen Henrichshhenrichs@bentley.edu(PRNewswire)Bentley University Logo.

New Update

New Delhi, Feb 13 (PTI) Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict treatment outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) patients, an advance that may lead to personalised treatments for the bacterial disease.Advertisment

 The study, published in the journal iScience, analysed multimodal data including diverse biomedical data from clinical tests, genomics, medical imaging and drug prescriptions from TB patients. By analysing data from patients with varying levels of drug resistance, the researchers discovered biomedical features predictive of treatment failure. They also uncovered drug regimens effective against specific sets of drug-resistant TB patients.Advertisment

 ""Our multimodal AI model accurately predicted treatment prognosis and outperformed existing models that focus on a narrow set of clinical data,"" said Sriram Chandrasekaran, corresponding author and associate professor at the University of Michigan, US. ""We identified drug regimens that were effective against certain types of drug-resistant TB across countries, which is very important due to the spread of drug-resistant TB,"" added study first author Awanti Sambarey, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan. Using AI, the team examined more than 5,000 patients.Advertisment

 ""This is real-world data we're talking about, so patients from different countries have different admission protocols. We worked with more than 200 biomedical features in our analysis; we examined demographic information such as age and gender as well as prior treatment history,"" Sambarey said. ""We also noted if the patients had other comorbidities, such as HIV, and then we worked with several imaging features such as their X-ray, CT scans, data from the pathogens, drug-resistance data, as well as genomic features and what mutations the pathogen had,"" she said. The researchers noted that it is  very difficult clinically to look at the data all together. That is where the role of AI comes in handy.Advertisment

 The team also studied the impact of the type of drug resistance present. ""You can look at a specific snapshot of the data, such as genomic features and find what mutations the infecting pathogen had, and ask what some of the long-term treatment implications are,"" Sambarey added. The researchers found that certain drug combinations worked better in patients with some types of resistance but not others, leading to treatment failure. They also found that drugs with antagonistic pharmaceutical interactions could result in worse outcomes. ""Using AI to weed out antagonistic drugs early in the drug-discovery process can avoid treatment failure down the line,"" Chandrasekaran noted. ""Instead of a one-size-fits-all treatment approach, we hope that the study of multimodal data will help physicians treat patients with more personalized treatments to provide the best outcomes,"" Sambarey added.

This move is aimed at enhancing customer service and improving overall efficiency. With the integration of AI, call centers in South Korea are revolutionizing the way they operate and interact with customers.AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. In the context of call centers, AI technology is being used to automate certain tasks and provide more personalized and efficient customer service.One of the key advantages of integrating AI in call centers is the ability to handle a large volume of calls simultaneously. AI-powered chatbots can engage with customers, answer frequently asked questions, and provide solutions to common issues. This not only reduces the waiting time for customers but also frees up human agents to focus on more complex and specialized tasks.Furthermore, AI technology can analyze customer data and provide valuable insights to call center agents. By understanding customer preferences and behavior patterns, agents can offer personalized recommendations and solutions, leading to higher customer satisfaction rates.FAQ:P: O que é IA?

Pioneering AI Artist Says The Technology Is Ultimately 'limiting'

Hamburg, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 14th Jan, 2024) An artist who shook up the cultural world with a haunting female portrait created by artificial intelligence has decided she's had enough of the new technology for now. Working with AI to create art is ultimately ""very frustrating and very limiting,"" Swedish-based artist and writer Supercomposite told AFP. For the moment, she has stopped working with AI and is writing a screenplay instead, saying her experience with AI art left her ""burned out"". ""It creates this dopamine path in your brain. It's very addictive to keep pushing that button and getting these results,"" she said. Supercomposite created the red-cheeked, hollow-eyed woman called ""Loab"" in 2022 when she was testing out the new artistic possibilities offered by AI.

  Her posts on social media of Loab and about the process to create her went viral, with commentators describing the images as ""disturbing"" and saying they had ""sparked some lengthy ethical conversations around visual aesthetics, art and technology"". Tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E have made it possible to generate images from written prompts.  Supercomposite -- whose real name is Steph Maj Swanson and is originally from the United States -- had been looking at so-called ""negative prompts"", designed to exclude certain elements from an image.

Training OpenAI's GPT-3 model is estimated to have used the equivalent of 120 average U.S. households' annual energy consumption. An average data center, critical infrastructure for AI, consumes the equivalent of heating 50,000 homes yearly. Microsoft and Google's use of water to cool data centers has grown by millions of gallons as they develop cutting-edge AI technologies.""Several factors contribute to the carbon footprint of AI systems throughout their life cycles,"" explains Niklas Sundberg, author of the article, ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem."" ""The AI industry must adopt practices that emphasize sustainability, make sustainability central to its AI ethics guidelines, and actively seek opportunities to reduce the environmental footprint of AI technologies.""Sundberg, a board member of SustainableIT.org and chief digital officer at Kuehne+Nagel, a global transport and logistics company, urges that transparency is critical. Reliable measurements of new models' energy use and carbon emissions must be published to raise awareness and encourage AI developers to compete on model sustainability. End users must also be aware of the factors that contribute to the environmental impacts of these tools to guide their use of them and add sustainability to the list of criteria they use to evaluate vendors and products.In ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem,"" Sundberg details the best practices for sustainable AI, which include the three R's: relocate, rightsize, and re-architect:Relocate: Not all energy is created equal. Carbon emissions can be mitigated by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Moving from on-premise to cloud-based computing can save on emissions and energy by 1.4x to 2x if it is well architected.Rightsize: Performance and energy efficiency can be increased by 2x to 5x when using processors and systems designed for machine learning training instead of running general-purpose servers not optimized for AI workloads. Optimization involves striking the ideal balance between the scope, model size, model quality, and efficient/sustainable resource use.Re-architect: Building a well-functioning AI model requires a robust software/hardware architecture designed for scaling and fine-tuning the model while maintaining a low latency response time. Choosing an effective machine learning model architecture, such as a sparse model, can improve machine learning quality while decreasing computation by 3x to 10x. Once an AI model has reached production, managing technical debt from a performance, security, and end-user experience perspective is crucial.In addition to the three R's, AI leaders must pay attention to data management, education and awareness, and compliance as avenues to improve sustainability.""By finding ways to minimize the energy and natural resources consumed by our AI development and deployment processes and drawing more attention to sustainability issues in discussions about AI, we can harness the power of this technology while minimizing its negative impact on our planet and society,"" concludes Sundberg.The MIT Sloan Management Review article ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem"" publishes at 8 a.m. ET on Dec. 12, 2023.About the AuthorNiklas Sundberg is the author of Sustainable IT Playbook for Technology Leaders (Packt Publishing, 2022) and a board member of SustainableIT.org, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing global sustainability through technology leadership.

Training OpenAI's GPT-3 model is estimated to have used the equivalent of 120 average U.S. households' annual energy consumption. An average data center, critical infrastructure for AI, consumes the equivalent of heating 50,000 homes yearly. Microsoft and Google's use of water to cool data centers has grown by millions of gallons as they develop cutting-edge AI technologies.""Several factors contribute to the carbon footprint of AI systems throughout their life cycles,"" explains Niklas Sundberg, author of the article, ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem."" ""The AI industry must adopt practices that emphasize sustainability, make sustainability central to its AI ethics guidelines, and actively seek opportunities to reduce the environmental footprint of AI technologies.""Sundberg, a board member of SustainableIT.org and chief digital officer at Kuehne+Nagel, a global transport and logistics company, urges that transparency is critical. Reliable measurements of new models' energy use and carbon emissions must be published to raise awareness and encourage AI developers to compete on model sustainability. End users must also be aware of the factors that contribute to the environmental impacts of these tools to guide their use of them and add sustainability to the list of criteria they use to evaluate vendors and products.In ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem,"" Sundberg details the best practices for sustainable AI, which include the three R's: relocate, rightsize, and re-architect:Relocate: Not all energy is created equal. Carbon emissions can be mitigated by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Moving from on-premise to cloud-based computing can save on emissions and energy by 1.4x to 2x if it is well architected.Rightsize: Performance and energy efficiency can be increased by 2x to 5x when using processors and systems designed for machine learning training instead of running general-purpose servers not optimized for AI workloads. Optimization involves striking the ideal balance between the scope, model size, model quality, and efficient/sustainable resource use.Re-architect: Building a well-functioning AI model requires a robust software/hardware architecture designed for scaling and fine-tuning the model while maintaining a low latency response time. Choosing an effective machine learning model architecture, such as a sparse model, can improve machine learning quality while decreasing computation by 3x to 10x. Once an AI model has reached production, managing technical debt from a performance, security, and end-user experience perspective is crucial.In addition to the three R's, AI leaders must pay attention to data management, education and awareness, and compliance as avenues to improve sustainability.""By finding ways to minimize the energy and natural resources consumed by our AI development and deployment processes and drawing more attention to sustainability issues in discussions about AI, we can harness the power of this technology while minimizing its negative impact on our planet and society,"" concludes Sundberg.The MIT Sloan Management Review article ""Tackling AI's Climate Change Problem"" publishes at 8 a.m. ET on Dec. 12, 2023.About the AuthorNiklas Sundberg is the author of Sustainable IT Playbook for Technology Leaders (Packt Publishing, 2022) and a board member of SustainableIT.org, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing global sustainability through technology leadership.

Walmart has deployed My Assistant, a generative AI tool for employees to help with generating content generation and summarizing large documents, acting as an overall ""creative partner"" for employees.

In detailing the new tool Wednesday, Walmart officials also tried to address broad concerns that AI tools like this will replace employees.
""There continues to be heightened debate about AI and automation, as well as its impact on the future of work,"" wrote Donna Morris, executive vice president and chief people officer, and Cheryl Ainoa, executive vice president of new business and emerging technologies, in a post on LinkedIn. ""Here's our belief: it will take both people and technology to deliver on our purpose to help people save money and live better.""
Generative AI ""can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it's trained on,"" the executives wrote.
This technology will free employees ""from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing more time and focus for improving the customer/member experience,"" according to the blog post.
Walmart may be ahead of some of the major HR vendors in releasing generative AI tools to help with employee productivity. Analysts and vendors see HR departments as significant users of the technology because their work substantially involves tasks where generative AI has seen successes, including communications, report writing and data analysis.

GenAI and productivity promises
""What Walmart is doing is intriguing because it's putting some of the highly personalized aspects of generative AI directly into the hands of the workforce,"" said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research & Advisory.

To illustrate how generative AI tools can be helpful to employees, Eubanks imagined some of the prompts employees can enter, such as, ""Explain my healthcare benefits in language a high school graduate can understand,"" or, ""During orientation, who are three people who I should connect with?""
In a new report, the Boston Consulting Group believes generative AI could boost HR productivity by up to 30%. It said generative AI can accomplish this by ""dramatically increasing self-service"" as well as content creation, visualization and as much as half of onboarding tasks.
""Generative AI promises to lower the frictions and boundaries between humans and software in a way we haven't seen before,"" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Gownder sees generative AI as a powerful aid for customer-facing roles. ""Navigating traditional mobile apps can be time-consuming and requires a learning curve,"" he said.
But a natural language generative AI interface can become a bridge to interact with backend systems such as inventory databases, making it easier for frontline workers ""while also lowering the burden of training them to use multiple software systems,"" he said.Patrick Thibodeau covers HCM and ERP technologies for TechTarget Editorial. He's worked for more than two decades as an enterprise IT reporter.

New Delhi: To become a global artificial intelligence (AI) hub, India needs to leverage its vast talent pool and establish AI-focused centres of excellence in collaboration with academic institutions and industry leaders, Stephen Ibaraki, a technology futurist and global thought leader, said on Saturday.
Ibaraki said the country, with its robust digital infrastructure, needs to continue investing in AI research and development, and creating a conducive environment for startups and innovation.

“Additionally, the government should implement policies that encourage foreign investments in AI and facilitate public-private partnerships to scale AI initiatives across sectors such as healthcare, agriculture and finance,” he said.
New technologies such as AI are emerging as the biggest strategic differentiator determining the economic prosperity of nations. India is the founding member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), having joined the multi-stakeholder initiative in June 2020.
The Cabinet recently approved an allocation of over Rs 10,300 crore towards the comprehensive ‘India AI Mission’ to democratise access to Al innovation pillars and ensure the global competitiveness of India’s Al ecosystem.
Canada-based Ibaraki hailed India AI Mission, saying nations can ensure responsible, safe and trusted AI by developing robust regulatory frameworks that emphasise ethical AI development and deployment while still ensuring innovation.
This includes implementing clear guidelines on data privacy, transparency and accountability.
Governments should work closely with international bodies, private sectors and academia to create standards that align with global best practices.
“Additionally, fostering public awareness and education on AI’s benefits and risks can help build trust and ensure that AI systems are used for the greater good,” stressed Ibaraki, who was in India to participate in an event organised by the Young President’s Organisation (YPO) in Bengaluru.
He also visited the Sona College of Technology in Tamil Nadu to address students on emerging technologies.
According to him, AI can supplement human jobs by taking over repetitive and mundane tasks, allowing workers to focus on more creative, strategic and complex aspects of their roles.
Reskilling and upskilling programmes are crucial to equip the workforce with the skills needed to work alongside AI. By fostering a collaborative environment where AI tools enhance human capabilities rather than replace them, businesses can drive innovation while ensuring job security.

Recent developments across quantum computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT communications, and database optimization seamlessly blend technical expertise with practical applications focused on human needs, directly accelerating technological progress. Quantum computing and IoT researcher Shujaatali Badami recognizes this technology that centers on solving real-world problems rather than developing new tools for the sake of it.
When Quantum Computing Goes Mainstream Shujaatali Badami has developed the quantum bootstrap method for microcanonical ensembles, which represents considerable growth. His technique removes the limitations of traditional quantum methods that bank on assumptions affecting accuracy. This results in more precise quantum simulations and enhances computational precision that implicate applications in finance, cryptography, and material science. Industry experts anticipate that this approach could reduce computational errors by up to 70% compared to conventional techniques, potentially expediting the timeline for achieving quantum advantage in real-world applications. As quantum computing transitions from research labs to commercial programs, Badami's contributions may prove fundamental to overcoming the persistent challenges of quantum decoherence and error correction that have limited practical implementation.
AI: More Than Just Chatbots Primary challenges in machine learning require deeper research, even though public attention is often focused on consumer-facing AI applications like chatbots. Shujaatali Badami's development of the Compressed Suffix Memory (CSM) algorithm constitutes a breakthrough in how AI systems handle incomplete information, similar to human decision-making processes.
Unlike traditional Utile Suffix Memory algorithms, which suffer from exponential state growth and overfitting, Badami's CSM algorithm dynamically adjusts tree depth and instance density thresholds. This method significantly improves decision-making efficiency in AI-driven environments, with direct applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
Shujaatali Badami maintains a balanced perspective on AI, acknowledging that technological revolutions create opportunities and challenges while ensuring that benefits are widely shared.
Blockchain Beyond the Hype Shujaatali Badami's research on blockchain applications create systems where trust is built directly into the technology itself. His quantum-inspired system for mitigating tail-switching in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems addresses a critical vulnerability in current implementations. By introducing stabilization mechanisms based on quantum measurement principles, his research enhances security in decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain solutions.
Badami describes this security enhancement as comparable to having a reliable lock on a front door – it provides peace of mind even if one has never experienced an attempted break-in. The Internet of Everyday Things
With projections indicating 25 billion connected IoT devices worldwide by 2032, the challenge extends outside connectivity to efficient and secure communication between devices with limited resources.
Shujaatali Badami's lightweight implementation of the OneM2M standard is a notable improvement for resource-constrained IoT devices. Traditional implementations, like running modern software on outdated computers, require excessive memory and processing power. His solution makes these standards accessible to simpler devices.
This advancement has profound implications for smart city applications, industrial automation, and connected devices more broadly. His framework allows more efficient device interactions while maintaining interoperability by reducing the computational and memory requirements for standard-compliant communication. He emphasizes that security cannot be an afterthought in IoT but must be integrated right from the start.
The Future of Work and Emerging Technologies Among Shujaatali Badami's most impactful contributions is his work on database optimization. His technique for Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees addresses a critical roadblock in modern database systems.
His 2024 paper published in IEEE has demonstrated a remarkable 10x improvement in processing speed under write-intensive workloads, which eliminated hidden read inefficiencies that previously limited performance. He has also developed a deferred update mechanism that postpones unnecessary lookups until the compaction phase.
This optimization enhances secondary index management and system throughput, making it particularly valuable for large-scale distributed databases and cloud storage solutions that are critical infrastructure components for an increasingly data-driven world.
The Human Element in Technological Progress Shujaatali Badami consistently returns to the human dimension of technological advancement, drawing on his interdisciplinary background that includes an MSc in Data Science from Liverpool John Moores University and an MBA from Deakin University. He expresses concern for equitable progress in evolving skills like typing from specialized to assumed knowledge. Through his work, Badami advocates for providing access to skills training to prevent the creation of new digital divides as technology advances.
As he prepares for his next research phase, with three additional papers scheduled for IEEE publication in 2025, his vision remains firm in elevating one's quality of life and maximizing social impact. Shujaatali Badami's research contributions and technical achievements spanning quantum computing, AI, blockchain, IoT, and database optimization have become stepping stones toward a more accessible, secure, and equitable technological future.

Hidden inside the foundation of popular artificial intelligence image-generators are thousands of images of child sexual abuse, according to a new report that urges companies to take action to address a harmful flaw in the technology they built.
Those same images have made it easier for AI systems to produce realistic and explicit imagery of fake children as well as transform social media photos of fully clothed real teens into nudes, much to the alarm of schools and law enforcement around the world.
Until recently, anti-abuse researchers thought the only way that some unchecked AI tools produced abusive imagery of children was by essentially combining what they’ve learned from two separate buckets of online images — adult pornography and benign photos of kids. 
But the Stanford Internet Observatory found more than 3,200 images of suspected child sexual abuse in the giant AI database LAION, an index of online images and captions that’s been used to train leading AI image-makers such as Stable Diffusion. The watchdog group based at Stanford University worked with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection and other anti-abuse charities to identify the illegal material and report the original photo links to law enforcement. It said roughly 1,000 of the images it found were externally validated. 
The response was immediate. On the eve of the Wednesday release of the Stanford Internet Observatory’s report, LAION told The Associated Press it was temporarily removing its datasets.
LAION, which stands for the nonprofit Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, said in a statement that it “has a zero tolerance policy for illegal content and in an abundance of caution, we have taken down the LAION datasets to ensure they are safe before republishing them.”


  

While the images account for just a fraction of LAION’s index of some 5.8 billion images, the Stanford group says it is likely influencing the ability of AI tools to generate harmful outputs and reinforcing the prior abuse of real victims who appear multiple times.
It’s not an easy problem to fix, and traces back to many generative AI projects being “effectively rushed to market” and made widely accessible because the field is so competitive, said Stanford Internet Observatory’s chief technologist David Thiel, who authored the report.
“Taking an entire internet-wide scrape and making that dataset to train models is something that should have been confined to a research operation, if anything, and is not something that should have been open-sourced without a lot more rigorous attention,” Thiel said in an interview.
A prominent LAION user that helped shape the dataset’s development is London-based startup Stability AI, maker of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image models. New versions of Stable Diffusion have made it much harder to create harmful content, but an older version introduced last year — which Stability AI says it didn’t release — is still baked into other applications and tools and remains “the most popular model for generating explicit imagery,” according to the Stanford report.


  

“We can’t take that back. That model is in the hands of many people on their local machines,” said Lloyd Richardson, director of information technology at the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, which runs Canada’s hotline for reporting online sexual exploitation. 
Stability AI on Wednesday said it only hosts filtered versions of Stable Diffusion and that “since taking over the exclusive development of Stable Diffusion, Stability AI has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of misuse.”
“Those filters remove unsafe content from reaching the models,” the company said in a prepared statement. “By removing that content before it ever reaches the model, we can help to prevent the model from generating unsafe content.”
LAION was the brainchild of a German researcher and teacher, Christoph Schuhmann, who told the AP earlier this year that part of the reason to make such a huge visual database publicly accessible was to ensure that the future of AI development isn’t controlled by a handful of powerful companies. 


  

“It will be much safer and much more fair if we can democratize it so that the whole research community and the whole general public can benefit from it,” he said.
Much of LAION’s data comes from another source, Common Crawl, a repository of data constantly trawled from the open internet, but Common Crawl’s executive director, Rich Skrenta, said it was “incumbent on” LAION to scan and filter what it took before making use of it. 
LAION said this week it developed “rigorous filters” to detect and remove illegal content before releasing its datasets and is still working to improve those filters. The Stanford report acknowledged LAION’s developers made some attempts to filter out “underage” explicit content but might have done a better job had they consulted earlier with child safety experts.
Many text-to-image generators are derived in some way from the LAION database, though it’s not always clear which ones. OpenAI, maker of DALL-E and ChatGPT, said it doesn’t use LAION and has fine-tuned its models to refuse requests for sexual content involving minors.


  

Google built its text-to-image Imagen model based on a LAION dataset but decided against making it public in 2022 after an audit of the database “uncovered a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes.”
Trying to clean up the data retroactively is difficult, so the Stanford Internet Observatory is calling for more drastic measures. One is for anyone who’s built training sets off of LAION‐5B — named for the more than 5 billion image-text pairs it contains — to “delete them or work with intermediaries to clean the material.” Another is to effectively make an older version of Stable Diffusion disappear from all but the darkest corners of the internet. 
“Legitimate platforms can stop offering versions of it for download,” particularly if they are frequently used to generate abusive images and have no safeguards to block them, Thiel said. 
As an example, Thiel called out CivitAI, a platform that’s favored by people making AI-generated pornography but which he said lacks safety measures to weigh it against making images of children. The report also calls on AI company Hugging Face, which distributes the training data for models, to implement better methods to report and remove links to abusive material.


  

Hugging Face said it is regularly working with regulators and child safety groups to identify and remove abusive material. Meanwhile, CivitAI said it has “strict policies” on the generation of images depicting children and has rolled out updates to provide more safeguards. The company also said it is working to ensure its policies are “adapting and growing” as the technology evolves. 
The Stanford report also questions whether any photos of children — even the most benign — should be fed into AI systems without their family’s consent due to protections in the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
Rebecca Portnoff, the director of data science at the anti-child sexual abuse organization Thorn, said her organization has conducted research that shows the prevalence of AI-generated images among abusers is small, but growing consistently.
Developers can mitigate these harms by making sure the datasets they use to develop AI models are clean of abuse materials. Portnoff said there are also opportunities to mitigate harmful uses down the line after models are already in circulation.


  

Tech companies and child safety groups currently assign videos and images a “hash” — unique digital signatures — to track and take down child abuse materials. According to Portnoff, the same concept can be applied to AI models that are being misused.
“It’s not currently happening,” she said. “But it’s something that in my opinion can and should be done.”

Hidden inside the foundation of popular artificial intelligence image-generators are thousands of images of child sexual abuse, according to a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory that urges technology companies to take action to address a harmful flaw in the technology they built. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) by: MATT O'BRIEN and HALELUYA HADERO, Associated Press Posted: Dec 20, 2023 / 07:19 PM CST Updated: Dec 20, 2023 / 07:22 PM CST SHARE Hidden inside the foundation of popular artificial intelligence image-generators are thousands of images of child sexual abuse, according to a new report that urges companies to take action to address a harmful flaw in the technology they built. Those same images have made it easier for AI systems to produce realistic and explicit imagery of fake children as well as transform social media photos of fully clothed real teens into nudes, much to the alarm of schools and law enforcement around the world. Until recently, anti-abuse researchers thought the only way that some unchecked AI tools produced abusive imagery of children was by essentially combining what they’ve learned from two separate buckets of online images — adult pornography and benign photos of kids. But the Stanford Internet Observatory found more than 3,200 images of suspected child sexual abuse in the giant AI database LAION, an index of online images and captions that’s been used to train leading AI image-makers such as Stable Diffusion. The watchdog group based at Stanford University worked with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection and other anti-abuse charities to identify the illegal material and report the original photo links to law enforcement. It said roughly 1,000 of the images it found were externally validated. The response was immediate. On the eve of the Wednesday release of the Stanford Internet Observatory’s report, LAION told The Associated Press it was temporarily removing its datasets. LAION, which stands for the nonprofit Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, said in a statement that it “has a zero tolerance policy for illegal content and in an abundance of caution, we have taken down the LAION datasets to ensure they are safe before republishing them.” While the images account for just a fraction of LAION’s index of some 5.8 billion images, the Stanford group says it is likely influencing the ability of AI tools to generate harmful outputs and reinforcing the prior abuse of real victims who appear multiple times. It’s not an easy problem to fix, and traces back to many generative AI projects being “effectively rushed to market” and made widely accessible because the field is so competitive, said Stanford Internet Observatory’s chief technologist David Thiel, who authored the report. “Taking an entire internet-wide scrape and making that dataset to train models is something that should have been confined to a research operation, if anything, and is not something that should have been open-sourced without a lot more rigorous attention,” Thiel said in an interview. A prominent LAION user that helped shape the dataset’s development is London-based startup Stability AI, maker of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image models. New versions of Stable Diffusion have made it much harder to create harmful content, but an older version introduced last year — which Stability AI says it didn’t release — is still baked into other applications and tools and remains “the most popular model for generating explicit imagery,” according to the Stanford report. “We can’t take that back. That model is in the hands of many people on their local machines,” said Lloyd Richardson, director of information technology at the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, which runs Canada’s hotline for reporting online sexual exploitation. Stability AI on Wednesday said it only hosts filtered versions of Stable Diffusion and that “since taking over the exclusive development of Stable Diffusion, Stability AI has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of misuse.” “Those filters remove unsafe content from reaching the models,” the company said in a prepared statement. “By removing that content before it ever reaches the model, we can help to prevent the model from generating unsafe content.” LAION was the brainchild of a German researcher and teacher, Christoph Schuhmann, who told the AP earlier this year that part of the reason to make such a huge visual database publicly accessible was to ensure that the future of AI development isn’t controlled by a handful of powerful companies. “It will be much safer and much more fair if we can democratize it so that the whole research community and the whole general public can benefit from it,” he said. Much of LAION’s data comes from another source, Common Crawl, a repository of data constantly trawled from the open internet, but Common Crawl’s executive director, Rich Skrenta, said it was “incumbent on” LAION to scan and filter what it took before making use of it. LAION said this week it developed “rigorous filters” to detect and remove illegal content before releasing its datasets and is still working to improve those filters. The Stanford report acknowledged LAION’s developers made some attempts to filter out “underage” explicit content but might have done a better job had they consulted earlier with child safety experts. Many text-to-image generators are derived in some way from the LAION database, though it’s not always clear which ones. OpenAI, maker of DALL-E and ChatGPT, said it doesn’t use LAION and has fine-tuned its models to refuse requests for sexual content involving minors. Google built its text-to-image Imagen model based on a LAION dataset but decided against making it public in 2022 after an audit of the database “uncovered a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes.” Trying to clean up the data retroactively is difficult, so the Stanford Internet Observatory is calling for more drastic measures. One is for anyone who’s built training sets off of LAION‐5B — named for the more than 5 billion image-text pairs it contains — to “delete them or work with intermediaries to clean the material.” Another is to effectively make an older version of Stable Diffusion disappear from all but the darkest corners of the internet. “Legitimate platforms can stop offering versions of it for download,” particularly if they are frequently used to generate abusive images and have no safeguards to block them, Thiel said.

Images created by Eliot Higgins with the use of artificial intelligence show a fictitious skirmish with Donald Trump and New York City police officers posted on Higgins' Twitter account, as photographed on an iPhone in Arlington, Va., Thursday, Mar. 23, 2023. The highly detailed, sensational images, which are not real, were produced using a sophisticated and widely accessible image generator.J. David Ake/AP

NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.
The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.
 But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.

 Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.
“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”

 While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.
Some of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.
In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.
The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.
Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.
Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”
He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.
But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence.
Too often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images of Trump as if they were genuine garnered more than 79,000 likes.
“You’re just seeing an image, and once you see something, you cannot unsee it,” Anlen said.
In another recent example, social media users shared a synthetic image supposedly capturing Putin kneeling and kissing the hand of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The image, which circulated as the Russian president welcomed Xi to the Kremlin this week, quickly became a crude meme.
It’s not clear who created created the image or what tool they used, but some clues gave the forgery away. The heads and shoes of the two leaders were slightly distorted, for example, and the room’s interior didn’t match the room where the actual meeting took place.
With synthetic images becoming increasingly difficult to discern from the real thing, the best way to combat visual misinformation is better public awareness and education, experts say.

 “It’s just becoming so easy and it’s so cheap to make these images that we should do whatever we can to make the public aware of how good this technology has gotten,” West said.
Higgins suggests social media companies could focus on developing technology to detect AI-generated images and integrate that into their platforms.
Twitter has a policy banning “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media” with the potential to deceive or harm. Annotations from Community Notes, Twitter's crowd-sourced fact checking project, were attached to some tweets to include the context that the Trump images were AI-generated.
When reached for comment Thursday, the company emailed back only an automated response.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Some of the fabricated Trump images were labeled as either “false” or “missing context” through its third-party fact-checking program, of which the AP is a participant.
Arthur Holland Michel, a fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs in New York who is focused on emerging technologies, said he worries the world isn't ready for the impending deluge.
He wonders how deepfakes involving ordinary people — harmful fake pictures of an ex-partner or a colleague, for example — will be regulated.
“From a policy perspective, I’m not sure we’re prepared to deal with this scale of disinformation at every level of society,” Michel wrote in an email. “My sense is that it’s going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.”

Tech Giants Call For a Pause in AI Experiments, Fearing ""Profound Risks to Society""

Tech30 March 2023By AFP 

 
(Yuichiro Chino/Moment/Getty Images) 
Billionaire mogul Elon Musk and a range of experts called on Wednesday for a pause in the development of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems to allow time to make sure they are safe.

An open letter, signed by more than 1,000 people so far including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was prompted by the release of GPT-4 from Microsoft-backed firm OpenAI.The company says its latest model is much more powerful than the previous version, which was used to power ChatGPT, a bot capable of generating tracts of text from the briefest of prompts.""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" said the open letter titled ""Pause Giant AI Experiments"".""Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,"" it said.Musk was an initial investor in OpenAI, spent years on its board, and his car firm Tesla develops AI systems to help power its self-driving technology, among other applications.


The letter, hosted by the Musk-funded Future of Life Institute, was signed by prominent critics as well as competitors of OpenAI like Stability AI chief Emad Mostaque.Canadian AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, also a signatory, at a virtual press conference in Montreal warned ""that society is not ready"" for this powerful tool, and its possible misuses.""Let's slow down. Let's make sure that we develop better guardrails,"" he said, calling for a thorough international discussion about AI and its implications, ""like we've done for nuclear power and nuclear weapons.""'Trustworthy and loyal'The letter quoted from a blog written by OpenAI founder Sam Altman, who suggested that ""at some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems"".​""We agree. That point is now,"" the authors of the open letter wrote.


​""Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.""​They called for governments to step in and impose a moratorium if companies failed to agree.​The six months should be used to develop safety protocols, AI governance systems, and refocus research on ensuring AI systems are more accurate, safe, ""trustworthy and loyal"".​The letter did not detail the dangers revealed by GPT-4.​But researchers including Gary Marcus of New York University, who signed the letter, have long argued that chatbots are great liars and have the potential to be superspreaders of disinformation.​However, author Cory Doctorow has compared the AI industry to a ""pump and dump"" scheme, arguing that both the potential and the threat of AI systems have been massively overhyped.© Agence France-Presse

                  Jeli Introduces ChatGPT-like Functionality to Incident Management

                      Aug 10, 2023
 
Jeli, a company specializing in helping companies understand and track incidents, has announced the beta release of a new feature that brings ChatGPT-like functionality to incident management. The addition of generative AI to the product is seen as a natural extension of Jeli’s mission to improve incident management processes.
According to Nora Jones, the founder and CEO of Jeli, the integration of generative AI was aimed at making it easier for humans to comprehend their roles during emergency situations and access relevant expertise. Jones explained that they began experimenting with generative AI to assist with incident management and found it beneficial both during and after incidents.
One of the key features of this new functionality is a summarizing tool that helps team members catch up on incidents that have extended over several days or weeks. By condensing the entire conversation surrounding an incident, the time spent searching through messages can be significantly reduced.
Jeli has also incorporated narrative builders into the product to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the incident. These builders generate markers that summarize important aspects such as detection, associated individuals, statements made, and the processes of diagnosis and repair. The intention behind this feature is to guide users in identifying anomalous patterns during incident analysis.
To implement this functionality, Jeli is utilizing the OpenAI API and has specifically trained the model on computer incident management. Jones mentioned that they have enhanced the responses through chain of thought reasoning to improve the accuracy of incident transcript classification.
In order to address the potential issue of erroneous information generated by the model, Jeli ensures transparency by allowing users to verify the source material and make necessary edits. Jones emphasized that the generated reports should not be considered as fully automated post mortems or incident reviews, but rather as a starting point for human intervention and refinement.
While the current version does not support querying of incident reports, Jeli plans to use the beta release to gather user feedback and make further enhancements based on the input received.
Jeli customers who are interested in accessing this new capability can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the beta program.

IrelandScotlandWalesIsle of ManGuernseyJerseyLocal NewsIllegal trade in AI child sex abuse images exposedPublished59 minutes agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Angus Crawford and Tony SmithBBC NewsPaedophiles are using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create and sell life-like child sexual abuse material, the BBC has found.   Some are accessing the images by paying subscriptions to accounts on mainstream content-sharing sites such as Patreon.Patreon said it had a ""zero tolerance"" policy about such imagery on its site.The National Police Chief's Council said it was ""outrageous"" that some platforms were making ""huge profits"" but not taking ""moral responsibility"".The makers of the abuse images are using AI software called Stable Diffusion, which was intended to generate images for use in art or graphic design. AI enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.The Stable Diffusion software allows users to describe, using word prompts, any image they want - and the programme then creates the image. But the BBC has found it is being used to create life-like images of child sexual abuse, including of the rape of babies and toddlers.UK police online child abuse investigation teams say they are already encountering such content.Image caption, Journalist Octavia Sheepshanks says there has been a ""huge flood"" of AI-generated imagesFreelance researcher and journalist Octavia Sheepshanks has been investigating this issue for several months. She contacted the BBC via children's charity the NSPCC in order to highlight her findings.""Since AI-generated images became possible, there has been this huge flood… it's not just very young girls, they're [paedophiles] talking about toddlers,"" she said. A ""pseudo image"" generated by a computer which depicts child sexual abuse is treated the same as a real image and is illegal to possess, publish or transfer in the UK.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead on child safeguarding, Ian Critchley, said it would be wrong to argue that because no real children were depicted in such ""synthetic"" images - that no-one was harmed.He warned that a paedophile could, ""move along that scale of offending from thought, to synthetic, to actually the abuse of a live child"".Abuse images are being shared via a three-stage process:Paedophiles make images using AI softwareThey promote pictures on platforms such as Japanese picture sharing website called PixivThese accounts have links to direct customers to their more explicit images,  which people can pay to view on accounts on sites such as PatreonSome of the image creators are posting on a popular Japanese social media platform called Pixiv, which is mainly used by artists sharing manga and anime. But because the site is hosted in Japan, where sharing sexualised cartoons and drawings of children is not illegal, the creators use it to promote their work in groups and via hashtags - which indexes topics using key words. A spokesman for Pixiv said it placed immense emphasis on addressing this issue. It said on 31 May it had banned all photo-realistic depictions of sexual content involving minors.The company said it had proactively strengthened its monitoring systems and was allocating substantial resources to counteract problems related to developments in AI.Ms Sheepshanks told the BBC her research suggested users appeared to be making child abuse images on an industrial scale.""The volume is just huge, so people [creators] will say 'we aim to do at least 1,000 images a month,'"" she said.Comments by users on individual images in Pixiv make it clear they have a sexual interest in children, with some users even offering to provide images and videos of abuse that were not AI-generated. Ms Sheepshanks has been monitoring some of the groups on the platform. ""Within those groups, which will have 100 members, people will be sharing, 'Oh here's a link to real stuff,' she says. ""The most awful stuff, I didn't even know words [the descriptions] like that existed.""Different pricing levels Many of the accounts on Pixiv include links in their biographies directing people to what they call  their ""uncensored content"" on the US-based content sharing site Patreon for what they call ""uncensored content"".Patreon is valued at approximately $4bn (£3.1bn) and claims to have more than 250,000 creators - most of them legitimate accounts belonging to well-known celebrities, journalists and writers. Fans can support creators by taking out monthly subscriptions to access blogs, podcasts, videos and images - paying as little as $3.85 (£3) per month.But our investigation found Patreon accounts offering AI-generated, photo-realistic obscene images of children for sale, with different levels of pricing depending on the type of material requested.One wrote on his account: ""I train my girls on my PC,"" adding that they show ""submission"". For $8.30 (£6.50) per month, another user offered ""exclusive uncensored art"".The BBC sent Patreon one example, which the platform confirmed was ""semi realistic and violates our policies"". It said the account was immediately removed.Patreon said it had a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, insisting: ""Creators cannot fund content dedicated to sexual themes involving minors.""The company said the increase in AI-generated harmful content on the internet was ""real and distressing"", adding that it had ""identified and removed increasing amounts"" of this material.""We already ban AI-generated synthetic child exploitation material,"" it said, describing itself as ""very proactive"", with dedicated teams, technology and partnerships to ""keep teens safe"".   Image caption, The NPCC's Ian Critchley said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for societyAI image generator Stable Diffusion was created as a global collaboration between academics and a number of companies, led by UK company Stability AI.Several versions have been released, with restrictions written into the code that control the kind of content that can be made.But last year, an earlier ""open source"" version was released to the public which allowed users to remove any filters and train it to produce any image - including illegal ones.Stability AI told the BBC it ""prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across our platforms, and our policies are clear that this includes CSAM (child sexual abuse material). ""We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes"".As AI continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people's privacy, their human rights or their safety.The NPCC's Ian Critchley said he was also concerned that the flood of realistic AI or ""synthetic"" images could slow down the process of identifying real victims of abuse.He explains: ""It creates additional demand, in terms of policing and law enforcement to identify where an actual child, wherever it is in the world, is being abused as opposed to an artificial or synthetic child.""Mr Critchley said he believed it was a pivotal moment for society.""We can ensure that the internet and tech allows the fantastic opportunities it creates for young people - or it can become a much more harmful place,"" he said.

IrelandScotlandWalesIsle of ManGuernseyJerseyLocal NewsIllegal trade in AI child sex abuse images exposedPublished59 minutes agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Angus Crawford and Tony SmithBBC NewsPaedophiles are using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create and sell life-like child sexual abuse material, the BBC has found. Some are accessing the images by paying subscriptions to accounts on mainstream content-sharing sites such as Patreon.Patreon said it had a ""zero tolerance"" policy about such imagery on its site.The National Police Chief's Council said it was ""outrageous"" that some platforms were making ""huge profits"" but not taking ""moral responsibility"".The makers of the abuse images are using AI software called Stable Diffusion, which was intended to generate images for use in art or graphic design. AI enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.The Stable Diffusion software allows users to describe, using word prompts, any image they want - and the programme then creates the image. But the BBC has found it is being used to create life-like images of child sexual abuse, including of the rape of babies and toddlers.UK police online child abuse investigation teams say they are already encountering such content.Image caption, Journalist Octavia Sheepshanks says there has been a ""huge flood"" of AI-generated imagesFreelance researcher and journalist Octavia Sheepshanks has been investigating this issue for several months. She contacted the BBC via children's charity the NSPCC in order to highlight her findings.""Since AI-generated images became possible, there has been this huge flood… it's not just very young girls, they're [paedophiles] talking about toddlers,"" she said. A ""pseudo image"" generated by a computer which depicts child sexual abuse is treated the same as a real image and is illegal to possess, publish or transfer in the UK.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead on child safeguarding, Ian Critchley, said it would be wrong to argue that because no real children were depicted in such ""synthetic"" images - that no-one was harmed.He warned that a paedophile could, ""move along that scale of offending from thought, to synthetic, to actually the abuse of a live child"".Abuse images are being shared via a three-stage process:Paedophiles make images using AI softwareThey promote pictures on platforms such as Japanese picture sharing website called PixivThese accounts have links to direct customers to their more explicit images, which people can pay to view on accounts on sites such as PatreonSome of the image creators are posting on a popular Japanese social media platform called Pixiv, which is mainly used by artists sharing manga and anime. But because the site is hosted in Japan, where sharing sexualised cartoons and drawings of children is not illegal, the creators use it to promote their work in groups and via hashtags - which indexes topics using key words. A spokesman for Pixiv said it placed immense emphasis on addressing this issue. It said on 31 May it had banned all photo-realistic depictions of sexual content involving minors.The company said it had proactively strengthened its monitoring systems and was allocating substantial resources to counteract problems related to developments in AI.Ms Sheepshanks told the BBC her research suggested users appeared to be making child abuse images on an industrial scale.""The volume is just huge, so people [creators] will say 'we aim to do at least 1,000 images a month,'"" she said.Comments by users on individual images in Pixiv make it clear they have a sexual interest in children, with some users even offering to provide images and videos of abuse that were not AI-generated. Ms Sheepshanks has been monitoring some of the groups on the platform. ""Within those groups, which will have 100 members, people will be sharing, 'Oh here's a link to real stuff,' she says. ""The most awful stuff, I didn't even know words [the descriptions] like that existed.""Different pricing levels Many of the accounts on Pixiv include links in their biographies directing people to what they call their ""uncensored content"" on the US-based content sharing site Patreon for what they call ""uncensored content"".Patreon is valued at approximately $4bn (£3.1bn) and claims to have more than 250,000 creators - most of them legitimate accounts belonging to well-known celebrities, journalists and writers. Fans can support creators by taking out monthly subscriptions to access blogs, podcasts, videos and images - paying as little as $3.85 (£3) per month.But our investigation found Patreon accounts offering AI-generated, photo-realistic obscene images of children for sale, with different levels of pricing depending on the type of material requested.One wrote on his account: ""I train my girls on my PC,"" adding that they show ""submission"". For $8.30 (£6.50) per month, another user offered ""exclusive uncensored art"".The BBC sent Patreon one example, which the platform confirmed was ""semi realistic and violates our policies"". It said the account was immediately removed.Patreon said it had a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, insisting: ""Creators cannot fund content dedicated to sexual themes involving minors.""The company said the increase in AI-generated harmful content on the internet was ""real and distressing"", adding that it had ""identified and removed increasing amounts"" of this material.""We already ban AI-generated synthetic child exploitation material,"" it said, describing itself as ""very proactive"", with dedicated teams, technology and partnerships to ""keep teens safe"". Image caption, The NPCC's Ian Critchley said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for societyAI image generator Stable Diffusion was created as a global collaboration between academics and a number of companies, led by UK company Stability AI.Several versions have been released, with restrictions written into the code that control the kind of content that can be made.But last year, an earlier ""open source"" version was released to the public which allowed users to remove any filters and train it to produce any image - including illegal ones.Stability AI told the BBC it ""prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across our platforms, and our policies are clear that this includes CSAM (child sexual abuse material). ""We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes"".As AI continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people's privacy, their human rights or their safety.The NPCC's Ian Critchley said he was also concerned that the flood of realistic AI or ""synthetic"" images could slow down the process of identifying real victims of abuse.He explains: ""It creates additional demand, in terms of policing and law enforcement to identify where an actual child, wherever it is in the world, is being abused as opposed to an artificial or synthetic child.""Mr Critchley said he believed it was a pivotal moment for society.""We can ensure that the internet and tech allows the fantastic opportunities it creates for young people - or it can become a much more harmful place,"" he said.

Who is ""Loab"" and what lesson about AI is she trying to teach us?

screen grab from Twitter feed of artist Supercomposite


Check out this super creepy AI creation, called ""Loab."" She was created by accident, but keeps appearing online, often in really scary and violent depictions and scenes. Smithsonian Magazine succinctly explains Loab: 

Earlier this month, Twitter user Supercomposite posted a thread of spooky images featuring a woman she calls ""Loab,"" who usually has red cheeks and dark, hollow eyes. Since then, the images, which range from unsettling to grotesque, have gone viral.
The images of Loab all come from an artificial intelligence (A.I.) art tool. These tools, like DALL-E 2, create images based on text prompts users input into the platform—and they are having a cultural moment as of late. Just last month, a piece of A.I.-created art won the Colorado State Fair art competition. Plenty of artists are experimenting with such tools to merge art with technology and create new, avant-garde pieces.

I also just read this fascinating deep dive into the promise and pitfalls of Artificial Intelligence by Ange Lavoipierre, writing for ABC News (Australia), which tells the story of Loab. ABC News explains:
Loab (pronounced ""lobe"") was first discovered in April this year by 31-year-old artist Steph Swanson, known online as Supercomposite.
Steph was at home in Uppsala, Sweden, experimenting with one of the many game-changing AI image generation tools which are now publicly available.
These tools produce original images that are based on the description you type in.
That day, she was using negative prompt weights, a technique which produces the theoretical opposite of whatever you ask for.
Steph's request for the opposite of Marlon Brando produced a business logo.
But when she asked the AI for the opposite of the description of the logo, something unexpected happened.
""I got four images of the same woman,"" she says.
Steph had never seen the AI behave in such a way before.
""If you use negative prompts … a lot of times it's really varied. So it was really unusual to get a bunch of images of what was recognisably the same woman,"" she says.
""Even if you describe a person in a positive prompt … you get people that match that description, but you don't get literally the same person.
""I immediately recognised this is an anomaly.""
She repeated the experiment straight away, to test whether it was a fluke – it wasn't.
""As I ran this prompt more and more and kept getting [Loab], it was like, 'Oh, this is like the only thing that this prompt makes, this woman.'""
The woman in the image was always sad, sometimes wet-cheeked like she'd been crying, with her mouth half open ""like she's sobbing"", says Steph.
Once, she appeared next to some garbled text spelling ""Loab"", and the name stuck.
Stranger still, Loab always appeared in the same location: a house with brownish-green walls, alongside cardboard boxes, junk, and the occasional stuffed toy.

The rest of the article describes the Loab saga in more detail, and dives into the sometimes fascinating, sometimes disturbing world of AI—a sector that, according to Ange Lavoipierre, is ""having a breakthrough moment, fuelled by hype, venture capital, and a decade of generous research funding."" But the Loab phenomenon, Lavoipierre argues, ""exposes just how little we understand about AI."" Is it true that ""AI itself is advising caution""? And if so, what are the warnings and will anyone heed them?
If you want to see more images of Loab, here's artist Supercomposite's Twitter thread.

X overlord Elon Musk has shared a bizarre AI video featuring world leaders, tech bosses and himself (obviously) parading the catwalk. Claiming it was ""High time for an AI fashion show"", Musk's unexpected clip bemused and disturbed his followers, providing us with yet another trivial use for AI.Sometimes an AI video comes along that momentarily cures my existentialism about the rise in artificial intelligence – this being one of them. For every shockingly good AI art generator, there's a mountain of weird AI-generated schlock that comes along with it. While I personally find Elon's AI catwalk clip a little cringe, I appreciate the humble reminder that AI can be a tool for frivolous fun.High time for an AI fashion show pic.twitter.com/ra6cHQ4AAuJuly 22, 2024First uploaded by YouTube creator Interdimensional TV, the video was originally titled ""Runway of Power."" It features world leaders such as Pope Francis, Vladamir Putin and Kim Jong Un, alongside tech giants Zucc, Tim Cook and Bill Gates. Even a wheelchair-bound Joe Biden makes an appearance alongside presidential candidate Kamala Harris in a campaign-inspired two-piece. Of course, Elon also makes a cameo, appearing scantily clad in some 'X' branded underwear, before transforming mid-strut into a futuristic Tesla space suit.""Thanks I hate it,"" one follower replied. ""The video I didn’t know I needed,"" another added, sharing a screenshot of Canadian President Justin Trudeau in a Maple Leaf dress. ""Wow!! That was pretty good.. disturbing but good,"" a conflicted commenter responded.

This isn't Elon's first foray into the world of AI, his Grok AI chatbot for X ruffled some feathers when it initially launched for its sarcastic 'based' responses. Since the rapid rise in AI technology, creatives have grown frequently frustrated with its potential threat to careers. In response, the 'Human Intelligence' logo trend is a glorious rebuttal of AI art that'll restore your faith in the power of human creativity.Get the Creative Bloq NewsletterDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

It features world leaders such as Pope Francis, Vladamir Putin and Kim Jong Un, alongside tech giants Zucc, Tim Cook and Bill Gates. Even a wheelchair-bound Joe Biden makes an appearance alongside presidential candidate Kamala Harris in a campaign-inspired two-piece. Of course, Elon also makes a cameo, appearing scantily clad in some 'X' branded underwear, before transforming mid-strut into a futuristic Tesla space suit.""Thanks I hate it,"" one follower replied. ""The video I didn’t know I needed,"" another added, sharing a screenshot of Canadian President Justin Trudeau in a Maple Leaf dress. ""Wow!! That was pretty good.. disturbing but good,"" a conflicted commenter responded. Runway of Power - YouTube Watch On This isn't Elon's first foray into the world of AI, his Grok AI chatbot for X ruffled some feathers when it initially launched for its sarcastic 'based' responses. Since the rapid rise in AI technology, creatives have grown frequently frustrated with its potential threat to careers. In response, the 'Human Intelligence' logo trend is a glorious rebuttal of AI art that'll restore your faith in the power of human creativity.Get the Creative Bloq NewsletterDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

Meta to lay off 10,000 more employees, continue investing in AI and metaverse

Halfthe parent company of Facebook, Instagram and the VR Meta Quests, will lay off another 10,000 employees and will eliminate about 5,000 of its currently open positions to align with the “new economic reality,” as part of strategies for what Mark Zuckerberg calls an “efficiency year.”

The new job cuts were announced on Facebook, and they add to another 11,000 confirmed last November who made up about 13% of the company’s workforce. In the post Zuckerberg says the decision was made due to rising interest rates in the US, geopolitical instability, tighter regulation and last year’s drop in Meta revenues which he called a “warning bell”. alarm”.

As we said at the beginning, the new layoffs are part of the company’s plans for the “year of efficiency“, which over the next few months will lead to headcount restructuring, the cancellation of low priority projects and fewer new hires.

“It’s going to be tough and there’s no avoiding it,” Zuckerberg said. “It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have contributed to our success. They are dedicated to our mission and I am personally grateful for all their efforts. We will support people the same way we have before and treat everyone with the gratitude that they deserve”.


In the Facebook post, Zuckerberg stated that in any case the artificial intelligences and the metaverse remain at the heart of Meta’s future strategies.

“I believe we are working on some of the most transformative technologies our industry has ever seen,” he added. “Our single largest investment is in advancing AI and integrating it into each of our products. We have the infrastructure to do this on an unprecedented scale, and I think the experiences it will enable will be amazing.”

“Our work building the metaverse and shaping the next generation of computing platforms also remains critical to defining the future of social connections. And our apps are growing and continuing to connect nearly half of the world’s population in new ways. This work it’s incredibly important and the stakes are high. The financial plan we have set out empowers us to make it happen.”

1:45 pm August 28, 2024 By Julian Horsey 
In recent years, AI image generation has made remarkable strides, empowering individuals to create stunning, personalized images with ease. Among the innovative tools available, the Flux AI image generation model stands out as a powerful solution for creating realistic AI images of yourself. By using advanced AI techniques and intuitive tools, you can now bring your digital likeness to life in ways that were once unimaginable.
Creating Custom A Images

Key Takeaways :

Flux AI image generation model allows for high-quality, realistic AI images based on input data.

Replicate offers a user-friendly interface for training AI models with configurable parameters.
Hugging Face supports various AI models and provides extensive documentation for training.
Cost-effective options, including free training or promotional codes, can minimize expenses.
Optimizing prompts using tools like Claude’s project feature enhances image quality and accuracy.
Generating images involves inputting specific prompts into the Flux AI model for desired outputs.
Enhancing generated images can be done using tools like Runway Gen-3 for animation and dynamic elements.


At the heart of this innovative approach lies the Flux AI image generation model. This sophisticated tool uses deep learning algorithms to analyze input data and generate high-quality, realistic images that closely resemble your unique features. The model’s versatility allows it to produce images in a wide range of styles and variations, ensuring that you can create personalized AI representations that align with your preferences and requirements.
To maximize the potential of the Flux AI model, it is essential to provide it with a diverse set of personal images for training. This process involves using powerful tools like Replicate and Hugging Face, which offer user-friendly interfaces and robust infrastructure for efficient model training.

Optimizing Prompts for Enhanced Results
While the Flux AI model is incredibly powerful, the quality of the generated images heavily relies on the prompts you provide. Crafting effective prompts is an art that requires experimentation and refinement. This is where Claude’s project feature comes into play, offering a valuable tool for optimizing your prompts and achieving superior results.
By iterating on different prompt structures, incorporating relevant keywords, and fine-tuning the language, you can guide the model to generate images that align closely with your vision. The key is to be specific and detailed in your prompts, providing the model with clear instructions on what elements to include and how to compose the image.
For instance, instead of a generic prompt like “Generate an image of me,” you could use a more targeted prompt such as “Generate an image of me wearing a blue shirt, standing in a park on a sunny day.” By providing these additional details, you enable the model to create a more accurate and contextually relevant representation of yourself.
Bringing Your AI Images to Life
Once you have generated a set of AI images using the Flux AI model, you can take your creations to the next level by using tools like Runway Gen-3. This powerful platform allows you to animate your AI-generated images, adding a dynamic and engaging dimension to your digital likeness.
With Runway Gen-3, you can explore various animation options, from subtle movements to more complex sequences. By bringing your AI images to life, you can create captivating visual content that stands out and leaves a lasting impression on your audience.
Maximizing Quality and Efficiency
To ensure that you consistently produce high-quality AI images of yourself, consider the following best practices:

Place the trigger word at the beginning of your prompts to focus the model’s attention on the most critical elements.
Use a diverse range of training images to enhance the model’s ability to generate accurate and varied representations of yourself.
Regularly update your model with new images and prompts to maintain its relevance and adapt to evolving styles and preferences.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can streamline your workflow and achieve impressive results with minimal effort.
Unlocking Affordable AI Image Creation
While training AI models can be resource-intensive, there are ways to minimize costs without compromising quality. Many platforms offer free training options or provide promotional codes that significantly reduce expenses. By exploring these cost-effective solutions, such as coupon codes for Replicate or Hugging Face, you can create stunning AI images of yourself without breaking the bank.
The advent of accessible AI image generation tools has opened up a world of possibilities for individuals seeking to create personalized digital representations. By using the power of the Flux AI model, optimizing prompts, and using tools like Replicate, Hugging Face, and Runway Gen-3, you can unleash your creativity and bring your AI-generated images to life. Embrace the potential of this technology, experiment with different techniques, and let your unique digital likeness shine in the ever-evolving landscape of AI image generation.

Bringing Your AI Images to Life Once you have generated a set of AI images using the Flux AI model, you can take your creations to the next level by using tools like Runway Gen-3. This powerful platform allows you to animate your AI-generated images, adding a dynamic and engaging dimension to your digital likeness. With Runway Gen-3, you can explore various animation options, from subtle movements to more complex sequences. By bringing your AI images to life, you can create captivating visual content that stands out and leaves a lasting impression on your audience. Maximizing Quality and Efficiency To ensure that you consistently produce high-quality AI images of yourself, consider the following best practices: Place the trigger word at the beginning of your prompts to focus the model’s attention on the most critical elements. Use a diverse range of training images to enhance the model’s ability to generate accurate and varied representations of yourself. Regularly update your model with new images and prompts to maintain its relevance and adapt to evolving styles and preferences. By adhering to these guidelines, you can streamline your workflow and achieve impressive results with minimal effort. Unlocking Affordable AI Image Creation While training AI models can be resource-intensive, there are ways to minimize costs without compromising quality. Many platforms offer free training options or provide promotional codes that significantly reduce expenses. By exploring these cost-effective solutions, such as coupon codes for Replicate or Hugging Face, you can create stunning AI images of yourself without breaking the bank. The advent of accessible AI image generation tools has opened up a world of possibilities for individuals seeking to create personalized digital representations. By using the power of the Flux AI model, optimizing prompts, and using tools like Replicate, Hugging Face, and Runway Gen-3, you can unleash your creativity and bring your AI-generated images to life.

        News TECHNOLOGY News ChatGPT owner OpenAI projects $1 billion in revenue by 2024         Feedback    ChatGPT owner OpenAI projects $1 billion in revenue by 2024  OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2.                          Reuters      Updated Dec 16, 2022, 8:47 AM IST                                  The company, which started releasing commercial products in 2020, has said its mission remains advancing AI safely for humanity. (Image: Reuters)    
ChatGPT, the new chatbot that is the talk of Silicon Valley, can spit out haikus, crack jokes in Italian and may soon be the scourge of teachers everywhere facing fake essays generated by the AI-powered technology.
But a question it can't fully answer is this: How will OpenAI make money?
The research organization, co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman and backed by $1 billion in funding from Microsoft Corp, is expecting its business to surge.
Three sources briefed on OpenAI's recent pitch to investors said the organization expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024.
The forecast, first reported by Reuters, represents how some in Silicon Valley are betting the underlying technology will go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos.
OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2. OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt, according to its website.
A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on its financials and strategy. The company, which started releasing commercial products in 2020, has said its mission remains advancing AI safely for humanity.
In a taste of what's to come, startups including Synthesia and Jasper, the latter having relied on OpenAI's tech, have drawn Fortune 500 companies to use their video-generation or AI copywriting tools, according to their websites. OpenAI has also attracted attention as an AI provider and potential Google search competitor, with ChatGPT answering queries for more than 1 million users so far.
Microsoft, providing OpenAI capital and computing power for its software, is a beneficiary. Asked about ChatGPT and whether Microsoft viewed such technology as experimental or strategic, its President Brad Smith told Reuters that AI has progressed faster than many predicted.
""We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future, but for everyone's future,"" he said in an interview this week.
Some investors expressed skepticism. Certain large venture-capital firms passed on backing OpenAI this year, questioning if it could justify a higher valuation or compete with rivals like Alphabet Inc-owned Google, sources familiar with its fundraise attempt who did not invest said.
A ""capped-profit"" structure that OpenAI created in 2019 also represented an unusual restriction for venture capital. OpenAI wanted to safeguard its mission by limiting backers' returns to 100 times their investment, or less in the future.
Others may be doubling down. Microsoft this year has looked at adding to its stake, two other sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Its hope is to drive business for Microsoft's cloud as more enterprises embrace AI.
MARKETING GURU
ChatGPT is based on what's known as a large language model, trained with text data so it can answer prompts like a human. Similarly powerful technology that Google built and is narrowly testing with users led one of its engineers this year to say the software was sentient.
Reality is far from that, many scientists say. ChatGPT's responses at times can be inaccurate or inappropriate, though it's built to decline hateful prompts and improve with feedback. OpenAI warns users, ChatGPT ""may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.""
The potential to generate flawed answers is one reason why a big player like Google has guarded public access closely, concerned that chatbots could harm users and damage its reputation. Google declined to comment.
The caution has created a void that startups have sought to fill. A company called Cohere, run partly by ex-Googlers, is working on commercial products after a $125 million fundraise led by Tiger Global in February. Another, Adept, announced a $65 million raise in April, and Stability AI touted $101 million in funding after the August release of its text-to-image generator.
Among those building applications atop OpenAI has been Jasper, which says it has drawn 80,000 marketers to draft ads, emails, blogs or other content with its software. The fast-growing company is expected to double its revenue to about $80 million this year, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its chief executive did not comment on the figure.
Gil Elbaz, co-founder of TenOneTen Ventures, said marketing represented one of the clearest businesses for today's chatbots. CarMax Inc, for instance, has used OpenAI through Microsoft's cloud to create thousands of customer review summaries for used cars that it is marketing, a case study on Microsoft's website shows.
Victor Riparbelli, CEO of text-to-video startup Synthesia, said money so far is ""in a lot of the more boring use cases.""
His London-based company has more than 20,000 customers including Amazon.com Inc using its software, which can generate corporate training and product marketing videos, though longer term the goal is AI producing Hollywood-quality content, he said. Amazon confirmed its use of the technology.
Such startups risk OpenAI or Big Tech companies spotting lucrative applications and copying them, which is why Synthesia built its key software in-house. At the same time, application developers could win out financially if technology like OpenAI's becomes a commodity, said Alan Cowen, chief executive at research startup Hume AI and a former Google researcher.
For now, OpenAI must determine how to sustain ChatGPT while shouldering what its CEO Altman described as ""eye-watering"" operating costs.
""I don't think OpenAI intended to make a business out of ChatGPT. I think it functions as a demo ... and a way to gather human feedback for free,"" said Cowen. ""Usage grew a lot faster than expected, so they are now contemplating monetization.""

Start your digital marketing journey today.South Korean chip giant SK hynix reported record quarterly profits Thursday thanks to soaring global demand for artificial intelligence, highlighting the firm's ability to weather mounting tariff threats.The world's second-largest memory chip maker dominates the market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors and is a key supplier for US titan Nvidia.SK hynix said it recorded an operating profit of 7.44 trillion won ($5.19 billion) -- a nearly 158 percent year-on-year increase -- on revenues of 17.64 trillion won from January–March.Both figures marked the company's second-highest quarterly results on record, following last quarter's performance.The news comes after Taiwanese chip giant TSMC last week announced a surge in net profit for the first quarter and forecast robust demand for artificial intelligence technology, despite the spectre of US tariffs on the critical sector.Net income also quadrupled compared to the previous year to 8.11 trillion won ($5.67 billion), with the firm saying the ""memory market ramped up faster than expected due to competition to develop AI systems and inventory accumulation demand"".Read alsoBoeing says China not accepting planes over US tariffsPAY ATTENTION: TUKO is in WhatsApp Channels now! Subscribe and read news in favourite messenger.The company added that its annual HBM sales for this year are expected to double compared to last year.Despite the news, SK hynix's shares fell more than one percent in Seoul morning trade. Less affected South Korea is a major exporter to the United States and its powerhouse semiconductor and auto industries would suffer greatly under President Donald Trump's looming 25 percent tariffs.The country is also home to the world's largest memory chip maker, Samsung.Experts say SK hynix's resilience is because of the company's growth in the DRAM market.SK hynix recently took the lead in DRAM revenues with a 36 percent market share, according to specialist research firm Counterpoint, surpassing Samsung for the first time and marking the first change in the top spot in over four decades.""Right now the world is focused on the impact of tariffs, so the question is: what's going to happen with HBM DRAM?"" said Counterpoint research director MS Hwang.Read alsoAuto Shanghai showcases new EV era despite tariff speedbumps""At least in the short term, the segment is less likely to be affected by any trade shock as AI demand should remain strong. More significantly, the end product for HBM is AI servers, which -- by definition -- can be borderless.""During a conference call, SK hynix noted that ""uncertainty has grown around demand for semiconductors"", but sales plans for key clients for the company this year ""remain unchanged"".""Global customers are, overall, maintaining their previously discussed memory demand levels with us,"" said an SK hynix official.""Additionally, some clients are pulling forward demand by requesting short-term supply advances,"" the company said.The company also noted that while roughly three-fifths of its sales are to US-based customers, tariffs apply only to products shipped directly to the United States.""Even when our clients are headquartered in the US, memory products are often shipped to locations outside the US, meaning the actual proportion of direct exports to the US is not particularly high,"" an SK hynix official said.

Research from three leading institutions utilizing Aidoc's PE AI solution demonstrated immense clinical value in reducing mean hospital length of stay, improving patient access, and correctly alerting care teams of suspected PEs with potential for advanced interventions.Aidoc Always On AI Logo (PRNewsfoto/Aidoc Medical LTD)(PRNewswire)The three studies highlighted the care advantages of utilizing Aidoc in the management of acute pulmonary embolisms, including numerous patient outcome benefits. Key findings from the studies presented include:37% hospital length of stay reduction with AI triggered PERT activation and initiation of advanced therapies68% increased access of catheter-directed interventional therapy for intermediate-high to high acuity PE patientsA highly sensitive (95%) early alerting system that successfully identified critical PE patients""Proving the robustness of any AI solution hinges on the application of scientific rigor and the scrutiny of peer review. Collaborating with these esteemed institutions to evaluate Aidoc's PE AI Solutions is critical to increasing awareness of the multi-faceted benefits AI can provide to patients, providers and health systems,"" shared Jerome Avondo, VP of Clinical Affairs and Reimbursement, Aidoc. ""A difficult to manage, high acuity patient population, such as PE, presents novel opportunities for assessing the impact of artificial intelligence and understanding the overall impact on outcomes.""These studies illustrate the ongoing evolution of Aidoc's AI-powered PE solution from an algorithm to enterprise-wide platform used by Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERTs) across entire health systems. Aidoc's always on AI runs in the background examining both dedicated CT exams and non-dedicated CT exams for both expected and unexpected PE, and brings suspected findings forward to care teams, faster.For PE management and care, Aidoc's solution serves as an end-to-end workflow used by multidisciplinary PERTs and diagnostic radiologists to manage acute PE. The solution automates the notification and suggests prioritization of CT imaging to aid radiologists in the triage and coordination of the disease's treatment.PE cases are directed to a mobile workflow, where PERTs can view imaging, access the electronic medical record (EMR) data, and communicate to expedite treatment decisions and improve patient care. PERTs can combine their expertise with the operational efficiency of artificial intelligence to address acute PE directly.University of Texas Medical Branch Reduces Length of Stay The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), a large academic health system, presented research showing how Aidoc's proprietary AI platform, the aiOS™, helped operationalize PE workflows and communications. UTMB assessed the clinical and patient outcomes following implementation of Aidoc's AI-powered PERT solution over a one-year period.Each AI finding had a chart review either retrospectively for PERT consultation eligibility (pre-AI) or prospectively to determine if a PERT consultation had occurred (post-AI). The mean ICU length of stay decreased by 33.5% (pre-AI:2.30 days, post-AI:1.53 days), while the mean hospital length of stay decreased by 36.7% (pre-AI: 6.70 days, post-AI: 4.24 days). These findings highlight the ability to enhance patient management and outcomes in the PE patient population.Jamaica Hospital Medical Center Increases PE Interventions with Aidoc Even in settings where a PERT is available, a substantial percentage of pulmonary embolism patients in the traditional workflow are treated without the involvement of the PERT. Medical researchers at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center examined the change in the volume of PE patients referred by the PERT for catheter-directed therapies, following the implementation of Aidoc in the PERT workflow. After introduction, the annual volume of patients referred for interventional therapies rose by 68% compared to the period before the implementation of Aidoc PE AI.University of Chicago Medicine Utilizes Aidoc AI to Prioritize and Triage PE CasesThe University of Chicago Department of Medicine published the final abstract involving Aidoc's PE AI, assessing the retrospective predictive power of the AI to identify patients that will require escalated care. Aidoc PE AI achieved a sensitivity of 95% in identifying patients that ultimately required advanced therapy in the pre-AI standard of care PERT.Interested in learning about how Aidoc's AI Solutions have impacted clinical outcomes across other clinical specialties of medicine?

What you need to know

Apple's new AI language modeling system, called ReaLM (Reference Resolution As Language Modeling), is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT systems. ReaLM will make interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive as the AI system can ""see"" and interpret on-screen content.As reported by Business Insider, the new Apple system ""outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to."" According to the researchers who created ReaLM, anyway. As ReaLM is a small language model, its less complex than large language models like GPT, which makes it faster at on-device tasks than larger models which require more computing power.What you need to knowIf Apple's research team is correct, ReaLM's context deciphering system will make ReaLM a better option for gleaning information from screenshots and other on-page images like recipes or phone numbers. While OpenAI's GPT 4 can contextualize images, the system was mostly trained on real-world images and not screenshots so it will be less accurate at deciphering that information than Apple's ReaLM system.While reading screenshots isn't the most glamorous use of artificial intelligence, it is one that plenty of people can find a use for in their daily lives. Moreso than image or text generation, in any case.Being a small language model on-device will also make ReaLM powered AI assistants much faster at returning that information than GPT powered systems. It is unclear at this time if ReaLM will be integrated into Apple's Siri assistant or other Apple products.While this is a small step compared to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's AI ventures, it does fit with Apple's general MO. The tech company tends to be slower to adopt new systems than its competition, which often results in smoother integration. So we will likely see Apple step up its AI game in the future in small ways.CategoryBack to LaptopsBrandAcer Apple Asus Dell Lenovo ProcessorAMD Ryzen 7 Intel Core i5 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i9 RAM8GB RAM 16GB RAM 32GB RAM 64GB RAM Storage Size256GB 512GB 1TB 2TB 4TB 8TB Screen Size13.3-inch 13.6-inch 14-inch 15.6-inch ColourBlack Blue Midnight Silver Screen TypeLED OLED ConditionNew Refurbished PriceAny PriceShowing 10 of 137 dealsFilters☰SORT BYPrice (low to high)Price (high to low)Product Name (A to Z)Product Name (Z to A)Retailer name (A to Z)Retailer name (Z to A)Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)(14-inch 512GB)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆1$1,999$1,799ViewLenovo Yoga 9i Gen 8(14-inch)2$1,477ViewAcer Swift 14(14-inch Intel Core i7)3$1,399.99ViewAcer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)(Blue)4$657.95$549.99ViewDell XPS 15 95305$1,499$1,199ViewLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 11)(Black)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆6$3,289ViewAsus ROG Strix Scar 18(1TB 32GB RAM)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆7$2,999.99ViewApple MacBook Air M2 20228$1,499ViewApple MacBook Air M2 2022(13.6-inch)9$899ViewDell XPS 15 953010$1,589.99ViewLoad more dealsStay in the know with Laptop MagGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

Here’s how it works. Software 'We show that ReaLM outperforms previous approaches, and performs roughly as well as the state-of-the-art LLM today, GPT-4': Apple throws down the gauntlet with new ReaLM AI on-device model News By Madeline Ricchiuto published 3 April 2024 The first look into Apple's AI plan has arrived (Image credit: AP) Jump to: What you need to know Apple's new AI language modeling system, called ReaLM (Reference Resolution As Language Modeling), is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT systems. ReaLM will make interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive as the AI system can ""see"" and interpret on-screen content.As reported by Business Insider, the new Apple system ""outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to."" According to the researchers who created ReaLM, anyway. As ReaLM is a small language model, its less complex than large language models like GPT, which makes it faster at on-device tasks than larger models which require more computing power.What you need to knowIf Apple's research team is correct, ReaLM's context deciphering system will make ReaLM a better option for gleaning information from screenshots and other on-page images like recipes or phone numbers. While OpenAI's GPT 4 can contextualize images, the system was mostly trained on real-world images and not screenshots so it will be less accurate at deciphering that information than Apple's ReaLM system.While reading screenshots isn't the most glamorous use of artificial intelligence, it is one that plenty of people can find a use for in their daily lives. Moreso than image or text generation, in any case.Being a small language model on-device will also make ReaLM powered AI assistants much faster at returning that information than GPT powered systems. It is unclear at this time if ReaLM will be integrated into Apple's Siri assistant or other Apple products.While this is a small step compared to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's AI ventures, it does fit with Apple's general MO. The tech company tends to be slower to adopt new systems than its competition, which often results in smoother integration. So we will likely see Apple step up its AI game in the future in small ways.CategoryBack to LaptopsBrandAcer Apple Asus Dell Lenovo ProcessorAMD Ryzen 7 Intel Core i5 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i9 RAM8GB RAM 16GB RAM 32GB RAM 64GB RAM Storage Size256GB 512GB 1TB 2TB 4TB 8TB Screen Size13.3-inch 13.6-inch 14-inch 15.6-inch ColourBlack Blue Midnight Silver Screen TypeLED OLED ConditionNew Refurbished PriceAny PriceShowing 10 of 137 dealsFilters☰SORT BYPrice (low to high)Price (high to low)Product Name (A to Z)Product Name (Z to A)Retailer name (A to Z)Retailer name (Z to A)Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)(14-inch 512GB)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆1$1,999$1,799ViewLenovo Yoga 9i Gen 8(14-inch)2$1,477ViewAcer Swift 14(14-inch Intel Core i7)3$1,399.99ViewAcer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)(Blue)4$657.95$549.99ViewDell XPS 15 95305$1,499$1,199ViewLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 11)(Black)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆6$3,289ViewAsus ROG Strix Scar 18(1TB 32GB RAM)Our Review☆☆☆☆☆7$2,999.99ViewApple MacBook Air M2 20228$1,499ViewApple MacBook Air M2 2022(13.6-inch)9$899ViewDell XPS 15 953010$1,589.99ViewLoad more dealsStay in the know with Laptop MagGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

Advertisement   What are the Dangers of AI?Yoshua Bengio is a professor and artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Montreal. He has spent the last four decades inventing technology that powers systems such as GPT-4, according to a report by the New York Times. For their work on neural networks, the researchers received the Turing Award, also known as “the Nobel Prize of computing,"" in 2018.A neural network is a mathematical system that learns abilities through data analysis. Around five years ago, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI began developing large language models, or L.L.Ms, which learned from massive amounts of digital text.L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own by identifying patterns in that text, such as blog posts, poems, and computer programmes, by identifying patterns in that text. They can even hold a conversation. This technique can assist computer programmers, writers, and other workers in coming up with new ideas and completing tasks more rapidly. However, Dr. Bengio and other experts cautioned that L.L.M.s can learn undesirable and unexpected behaviours, the Times reported.These systems have the potential to generate false, biassed, or otherwise harmful information. Systems like GPT-4 make up information and misinterpret facts, a process known as “hallucination.""These issues are being addressed by businesses. However, experts such as Dr. Bengio are concerned that as researchers develop more powerful systems, they will introduce new risks.Some Risks InvolvedAccording to a report by Bernard Marr, there are many risks involved with the advancement of AI.One way AI can bring problems is when it is trained to perform something hazardous, such as autonomous weapons programmed to kill. It is also possible that the nuclear arms race may be supplanted by a worldwide autonomous weapons race.Another thing to be wary of is social media, which, with its self-powered algorithms, is extremely effective at target marketing. They have a solid idea of who we are, what we enjoy, and what we think. Investigations are still ongoing to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and others associated with the firm who used data from 50 million Facebook users to try to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, but if the accusations are true, it demonstrates AI’s power for social manipulation. AI can target individuals identified by algorithms and personal data and spread any information they choose, in whichever style they deem most convincing—fact or fiction.It is now possible to track and assess an individual’s every step both online and while going about their everyday business. Cameras are almost everywhere, and facial recognition algorithms recognise you. In fact, this is the type of data that will power China’s social credit system, which is expected to assign a personal score to each of its 1.4 billion citizens based on how they behave—things like whether they jaywalk, smoke in non-smoking areas, and how much time they spend playing video games.Because machines can collect, track, and analyse so much information about you, it is entirely possible that those machines will use that information against you, which can result in discrimination, the report by Bernard Marr says.AFP contributed to this reportRead all the Latest Explainers hereFollow us on About the AuthorNews DeskThe News Desk is a team of passionate editors and writers who break and analyse ...Read MoreTags:ai | artificial intelligence | ChatGPT | Googlefirst published: May 03, 2023, 14:28 ISTlast updated: May 03, 2023, 14:28 ISTRead MoreTRENDING NEWSWatch: Kayaking Champ Descends 300ft Down A Waterfall In MexicoUS Woman, Homeless For 6 Years, Wins Rs 40 Crore In LotteryIf You've Ghosted Someone There May Be a Psychological Reason You Did ItMore Trending News MORE NEWS South Africans Want Their Diamond Back.

Advertisement Hinton did not sign that letter at the time, but told The New York Times that scientists should not “scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it."" Advertisement What are the Dangers of AI?Yoshua Bengio is a professor and artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Montreal. He has spent the last four decades inventing technology that powers systems such as GPT-4, according to a report by the New York Times. For their work on neural networks, the researchers received the Turing Award, also known as “the Nobel Prize of computing,"" in 2018.A neural network is a mathematical system that learns abilities through data analysis. Around five years ago, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI began developing large language models, or L.L.Ms, which learned from massive amounts of digital text.L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own by identifying patterns in that text, such as blog posts, poems, and computer programmes, by identifying patterns in that text. They can even hold a conversation. This technique can assist computer programmers, writers, and other workers in coming up with new ideas and completing tasks more rapidly. However, Dr. Bengio and other experts cautioned that L.L.M.s can learn undesirable and unexpected behaviours, the Times reported.These systems have the potential to generate false, biassed, or otherwise harmful information. Systems like GPT-4 make up information and misinterpret facts, a process known as “hallucination.""These issues are being addressed by businesses. However, experts such as Dr. Bengio are concerned that as researchers develop more powerful systems, they will introduce new risks.Some Risks InvolvedAccording to a report by Bernard Marr, there are many risks involved with the advancement of AI.One way AI can bring problems is when it is trained to perform something hazardous, such as autonomous weapons programmed to kill. It is also possible that the nuclear arms race may be supplanted by a worldwide autonomous weapons race.Another thing to be wary of is social media, which, with its self-powered algorithms, is extremely effective at target marketing. They have a solid idea of who we are, what we enjoy, and what we think. Investigations are still ongoing to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and others associated with the firm who used data from 50 million Facebook users to try to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, but if the accusations are true, it demonstrates AI’s power for social manipulation. AI can target individuals identified by algorithms and personal data and spread any information they choose, in whichever style they deem most convincing—fact or fiction.It is now possible to track and assess an individual’s every step both online and while going about their everyday business. Cameras are almost everywhere, and facial recognition algorithms recognise you. In fact, this is the type of data that will power China’s social credit system, which is expected to assign a personal score to each of its 1.4 billion citizens based on how they behave—things like whether they jaywalk, smoke in non-smoking areas, and how much time they spend playing video games.Because machines can collect, track, and analyse so much information about you, it is entirely possible that those machines will use that information against you, which can result in discrimination, the report by Bernard Marr says.AFP contributed to this reportRead all the Latest Explainers hereFollow us on About the AuthorNews DeskThe News Desk is a team of passionate editors and writers who break and analyse ...",1,Negative,0

SEATTLE — The school year is officially underway for tens of thousands of students in Washington. For many in the Seattle area, their first day of school was this week. 

But as the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, goes up, school administrators are cracking down. 

Last year, Seattle Public Schools announced they had blocked a software called ChatGPT on all student devices. At other school districts, like Lake Washington and Bellevue, policies have been updated to include stern warnings about the consequences of using AI to cheat. 
One teen was honest about a prior instance of academic dishonesty. 

""I was cheating on my math test,"" said Miles Harrison. The high school senior was an open book when it came to how he once used AI software on his computer to pass the test. 

""I wanted to pass it, it was my final for that class, and the principal walked up behind me,"" he said.  

She saw his screen, and his heart dropped. But, to his surprise, ""She was just like, 'Oh you're using AI. Cool.'"" he recalled. ""She didn't think anything of it and I ended up passing the class.""  

It's a mixed bag with how people feel about AI, including the extent of their knowledge of it. But AI is also often used for more than just passing a test. 

""I've also seen people use it to write essays and things like that,"" said Jullian Todaro, an SPS high school student. 

The idea behind ChatGPT is, essentially, it can generate a human-like response for anything you want. 

Users can have it write a five-paragraph essay about Catcher in the Rye, World War II, or anything else they can think of. The product will likely look like a finely-tuned, thought-provoking essay. 

One Seattle Public School parent is preparing to have conversations with her daughter about it when she gets older. 

""She will use some of these tools with some oversight from us,"" said Allison Augustyn, an SPS parent. She is also a college professor and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. 

""I worry about if people are using it to avoid critical thinking,"" Augustyn said. 

She said the technology is neither good nor bad; just different. 

""It's actually brought a lot of good discussions to the forefront,"" she said. 

So can teachers detect when a student's paper was written by a bot? 

Turnitin.com claims they can; teachers can run homework through their detection software. 

""There are ways of like, the teacher can tell if it’s like plagiarized or generated,"" said Evan Melendez, an SPS teen. 
Is the fear of being caught... enough? 

Another teen, Spencer White, believes so. 

""I don’t really know anybody who, like, tries to use it to cheat,” said White.  

But another SPS mother, Make Gallitelli, said she wonders whether-- with the right rules and monitoring around it-- it can be used in a positive way. 

""How that technology can be applied to helping kids that maybe have a harder time writing,"" Gallitelli said. 

She said she would like to see some research done about whether it can inspire critical thinking, rather than hinder it.

As a result, technologies such as AI and robotics have gained significant momentum in the country's healthcare sector.""Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel virtually inaugurated the 'Center of Excellence in Robotic Gastrointestinal Surgery' at Kaizen Hospital in Ahmedabad. Marking a significant milestone, Kaizen Hospital becoming the first in the country to perform 100 robotic gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries, the Chief Minister delivered an inspiring address to commemorate the achievement,"" the release read. In this context, Chief Minister Patel noted that building on the foundation laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state government has installed the CyberKnife - a Robotic Linear Accelerator Machine - for advanced radiotherapy treatment at the cancer hospital, at an investment of Rs95 crore. Robotic surgery has also been initiated at U.N. Mehta Hospital since 2022. Over the past decade, under the Prime Minister's leadership, sustained efforts have been made to develop a highly skilled workforce in the medical sector.""Chief Minister highlighted the rapidly growing use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare. With the advent of AI and telemedicine, quality medical services are now reaching even the most remote regions. AI has made it easier to access patients' medical histories and provides clinical decision support to doctors, significantly reducing treatment time. In emergency situations, it also enables swift and effective care,"" the release read.

Chief Minister Patel added that the state government has launched such an AI-based digital ICU at UN Mehta Hospital. Whenever the Prime Minister engages in dialogue with AI leaders, he places special emphasis on the use of AI in the health sector. When he meets startup innovators, he inspires them to bring practical solutions to challenges in the healthcare sector. An AI Center of Excellence has been set up at GIFT City, where we also encourage health-sector startups.""Chief Minister Patel stated that the number of medical colleges in the country has increased from 319 to 703.

""Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel stated that Gujarat has consistently supported emerging technologies in the medical sector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced robotic surgery in Gujarat as early as 2013. Now is the time to integrate artificial intelligence into the healthcare sector. The state government has paved the way for the integration of artificial intelligence at various stages within Gujarat's healthcare sector,"" as per a Gujarat Chief Minister's office release. Advt Narendra Modi has made efforts to ensure excellent and affordable healthcare for every citizen of the country through futuristic technology while simultaneously strengthening advanced infrastructure and the essential manpower for modern medical science.

Marking a significant milestone, Kaizen Hospital becoming the first in the country to perform 100 robotic gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries, the Chief Minister delivered an inspiring address to commemorate the achievement,"" the release read.

Robotic surgery has also been initiated at U.N. Mehta Hospital since 2022. Over the past decade, under the Prime Minister's leadership, sustained efforts have been made to develop a highly skilled workforce in the medical sector.""Chief Minister highlighted the rapidly growing use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare. With the advent of AI and telemedicine, quality medical services are now reaching even the most remote regions.

OpenStack Dalmatian Delivers Enhancements for AI Workloads, Security, User Experience as Demand for OpenStack Surges 

					October 2024 by  
					
						Marc Jacob

  The OpenStack community  released 2024.2 Dalmatian, the 30th version of the world’s most widely deployed open source cloud infrastructure software. Around 500 contributors from organizations including Red Hat, Cleura, Mirantis, Walmart, BBC R&D, Blizzard Entertainment, and NVIDIA built Dalmatian, delivering support for AI workloads, enhanced security, and improved user experiences among widespread maintenance updates. This release comes as the OpenStack market is estimated at $22.81 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$91.44 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 32%.

OpenStack is currently experiencing a significant surge in adoption, attributed largely to the software’s popularity as a VMware alternative and its unique suitability for supporting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and other high performance computing (HPC) workloads. Another driver of OpenStack adoption is its integration with Linux and Kubernetes in the “Open Infrastructure Blueprint,” which empowers users to deploy container-based, virtual machine-based, and bare metal-based workloads in the same infrastructure.
With more than 45 million cores in production, OpenStack is embraced by thousands of users of all sizes and across industries, including many “mega-users” running a million cores or more.
Skyline Now Available as Production-Ready, Next Generation Dashboard
In Dalmatian, Skyline and its modernized web UI are now fully supported as part of the official OpenStack release. Previously released as a technology preview, Skyline is now production ready and has added new functionality in Dalmatian including support for Masakari, Designate and FWaaS, as well as several translations. 
This milestone comes as the global ecosystem is eyeing Skyline as their dashboard of choice to provide an improved end user experience. In August 2024, Rackspace announced their newest service, Rackspace OpenStack Enterprise, which includes Skyline as the dashboard instead of Horizon.
Support of AI & HPC Workloads 
Dalmatian advances OpenStack’s support of AI and HPC workloads. For example:
•	Blazar introduced support for reserving compute instances based on existing Nova flavors. This can be used to provide reservation of GPU instances.
•	In Nova, with the libvirt driver and libvirt version 7.3.0 or newer, mediated devices for vGPUs are now persisted across reboots of a compute host. This offers more convenience and efficiency improvements for users of hardware accelerators, many of whom currently may be training AI systems.
Security
Security enhancements are a common theme in many OpenStack Dalmatian components. Highlights include the following:
•	Ironic has enhanced multiple security aspects. For example, it now requires rescue passwords to be hashed, it has reduced the logged nodes information during the cleaning phase to avoid showing sensitive data, and it has hardened the communication between the Ironic services and the Ironic agent requiring an HTTPS URL by default. In addition, Ironic now allows users to perform firmware updates on active nodes with the firmware interface, using the redfish driver firmware update feature as a service step. This can be used to facilitate applying firmware security patches.
•	Neutron has added manager role support to its APIs, meeting the next phase of the Secure RBAC community goals.
•	Nova now automatically detects virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) support for compute services if libvirt version is above 8.0.0 and if swtpm is installed on the node. It will also automatically get the TPM models that are supported. In addition, Nova users can now require Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections for SPICE consoles.
User Interface Enhancements
OpenStack Dalmatian showcases several ways the community continues to adapt the software to enhance usability. These features are key for organizations who are migrating from VMware to OpenStack.
For example: 
•	Ironic has added runbooks, a new API concept to enable self-service of maintenance items on nodes by project members. Runbooks are curated lists of steps that can be run on nodes only associated via traits and used in lieu of an explicit list of steps for manual cleaning or servicing. They also follow RBAC rules, allowing projects to limit who can maintain and use a runbook.
•	Manila: Users now have the ability to manipulate storage capabilities through shared metadata. Cloud operators can determine which capabilities are updatable, and users are then notified about the status of the updates through asynchronous user messages.
Simplification of OpenStack Upgrades
In 2022, the OpenStack community adopted a once-a-year SLURP release cadence designed to ease the demands upon operators to upgrade every six months. OpenStack Dalmatian is a “not-SLURP release,” which means it is offered in the six-month interim of annual SLURP releases expressly for those who wish to upgrade more frequently.

Around 500 contributors from organizations including Red Hat, Cleura, Mirantis, Walmart, BBC R&D, Blizzard Entertainment, and NVIDIA built Dalmatian, delivering support for AI workloads, enhanced security, and improved user experiences among widespread maintenance updates. This release comes as the OpenStack market is estimated at $22.81 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$91.44 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 32%. OpenStack is currently experiencing a significant surge in adoption, attributed largely to the software’s popularity as a VMware alternative and its unique suitability for supporting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and other high performance computing (HPC) workloads. Another driver of OpenStack adoption is its integration with Linux and Kubernetes in the “Open Infrastructure Blueprint,” which empowers users to deploy container-based, virtual machine-based, and bare metal-based workloads in the same infrastructure. With more than 45 million cores in production, OpenStack is embraced by thousands of users of all sizes and across industries, including many “mega-users” running a million cores or more. Skyline Now Available as Production-Ready, Next Generation Dashboard In Dalmatian, Skyline and its modernized web UI are now fully supported as part of the official OpenStack release. Previously released as a technology preview, Skyline is now production ready and has added new functionality in Dalmatian including support for Masakari, Designate and FWaaS, as well as several translations. This milestone comes as the global ecosystem is eyeing Skyline as their dashboard of choice to provide an improved end user experience. In August 2024, Rackspace announced their newest service, Rackspace OpenStack Enterprise, which includes Skyline as the dashboard instead of Horizon. Support of AI & HPC Workloads Dalmatian advances OpenStack’s support of AI and HPC workloads. For example: • Blazar introduced support for reserving compute instances based on existing Nova flavors. This can be used to provide reservation of GPU instances. • In Nova, with the libvirt driver and libvirt version 7.3.0 or newer, mediated devices for vGPUs are now persisted across reboots of a compute host. This offers more convenience and efficiency improvements for users of hardware accelerators, many of whom currently may be training AI systems. Security Security enhancements are a common theme in many OpenStack Dalmatian components. Highlights include the following: • Ironic has enhanced multiple security aspects. For example, it now requires rescue passwords to be hashed, it has reduced the logged nodes information during the cleaning phase to avoid showing sensitive data, and it has hardened the communication between the Ironic services and the Ironic agent requiring an HTTPS URL by default. In addition, Ironic now allows users to perform firmware updates on active nodes with the firmware interface, using the redfish driver firmware update feature as a service step. This can be used to facilitate applying firmware security patches. • Neutron has added manager role support to its APIs, meeting the next phase of the Secure RBAC community goals. • Nova now automatically detects virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) support for compute services if libvirt version is above 8.0.0 and if swtpm is installed on the node.

TikTok sacks intern for interfering with AI models, US safety agency investigates Tesla

21 October 202421 October 2024 Chris Price News

TikTok owner, ByteDance, says it has sacked an intern for “maliciously interfering” with the training of one of its artificial intelligence (AI) models. But the firm rejected claims about the extent of the damage caused by the unnamed individual, saying they “contain some exaggerations and inaccuracies”. It comes after reports about the incident spread over the weekend on social media. The Chinese technology giant’s Doubao ChatGPT-like generative AI model is the country’s most popular AI chatbot. “The individual was an intern with the [advertising] technology team and has no experience with the AI Lab,” ByteDance said in a statement. BBC
The US government’s road safety agency has opened an investigation into 2.4m Tesla vehicles with the automaker’s Full Self-Driving software after four reported collisions, including a fatal crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Friday said it was opening the preliminary evaluation after four reports of crashes when Full Self-Driving was engaged during reduced roadway visibility like sun glare, fog or airborne dust. In one crash “the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury,” the NHTSA said. The Guardian 

The first UK trial of a rigid sail that can be fitted on commercial ships to reduce their carbon footprint is under way in the Irish Sea. The sail being tested is more like an aircraft wing than the traditional sheet of billowing canvas. And the vessel it’s been fixed to is no ordinary ship either. It’s one of the UK’s fleet of three nuclear transport vessels, specially designed to move high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel stored at Sellafield in Cumbria to destinations like Japan under long-standing nuclear decommissioning treaties. Sky News 
Sky has reported a £750m loss after the Qatar World Cup pushed up broadcasting costs and the company wrote down more than £1bn on its operations in Italy and Germany. The British broadcaster, which is owned by the US telecoms and media giant Comcast, doubled its operating losses as it shifts from its traditional satellite model to broadcasting channels over internet streaming. Accounts for 2023 filed at Companies House showed revenues slightly up at £10.2bn….However, the company’s costs also rose in the year, partly because of the timing of the Fifa World Cup at the end of 2022. Telegraph 
Music and sports ticket sellers would be required to tell fans maximum prices at the start of the buying process under a new proposed law following the Oasis “dynamic pricing” backlash. Prompted by the pricing method that left Oasis fans paying much more than they expected for the band’s 2025 reunion shows, the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill has been put forward in the House of Commons. Labour MP Rupa Huq, who has proposed the bill, said she wants the law changed to improve pricing transparency and prevent fans from being ripped off. Sky News 
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, expected to go official in January 2025, is tipped to come in four colors – black, green, blue, and titanium. This information comes from reliable tipster Ice Universe, who said these are the regular options, and it’s unclear how many online-exclusive colors the smartphone will have. 
 
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s leaked renders (Source: OnLeaks and Android Headlines)


Thanks to leaked renders we also know what the smartphone will look like. It will have a punch-hole display on the front and a new camera design on the rear.  Rumors claim the rear camera setup will be a combination of 200MP primary (ISOCELL HP2), 50MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto (3x optical), and 50MP telephoto (5x optical) units. The selfie camera is said to use a 12MP sensor. GSM Arena

                        Reuters      Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58 per cent leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from US government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs.     TSMC is set to report a net profit of TWD 377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended on December 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of TWD 238.7 billion.     TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in US dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers.     ""From the US government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present,"" he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan.     Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. ""Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen,"" he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81 per cent last year, compared with a 28.5 per cent gain for the broader market.

    Contextual AI Unveils Enterprise Language Model Innovation with $20M Seed Funding
    
        Jun 08, 2023
           Contextual AI has come out of stealth, raising $20 million in seed funding for its pursuit of developing the next wave of language models for enterprise applications. Co-founded by Douwe Kiela, the technology aims to resolve issues limiting the adoption of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 by enterprises with strict compliance and governance requirements.Despite demonstrating the potential to revolutionize industries, existing LLMs are afflicted with limitations such as producing fabricated results with high confidence and difficulties in modifying their knowledge base.

Co-founded by Douwe Kiela, the technology aims to resolve issues limiting the adoption of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 by enterprises with strict compliance and governance requirements.Despite demonstrating the potential to revolutionize industries, existing LLMs are afflicted with limitations such as producing fabricated results with high confidence and difficulties in modifying their knowledge base.

To that end, Kiela and his co-founder, Amanpreet Singh, rely on their background in AI development at Hugging Face and Meta.Drawing upon the research experience of Kiela, who led efforts on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) while at Meta, the technology aims to develop a superior text-generating AI for enterprise uses. In essence, RAG works by enhancing LLMs with external sources, such as files and webpages, to improve their performance.When provided with a question, RAG essentially searches for relevant data within these external sources, packaging the information with the original prompt and feeding it to an LLM. In turn, this generates a context-aware response, offering improved precision and reliability compared to conventional LLMs.In addressing issues surrounding customization and attribution in LLMs, RAG promises improved performance while sidestepping the need for retraining or fine-tuning.

Google AI brings the heat to fight scorching urban temperatures

With 2024 expected to exceed 2023 as the hottest year on record, rising temperatures continue to affect urban areas disproportionately. Urban heat islands -- locations where infrastructure such as buildings and roads trap and radiate heat -- experience temperature increases at twice the global average. This poses a particular risk to vulnerable populations, including older adults, children, and people with chronic health issues. From 2017 to 2021, heat-related deaths among those aged 65 and older increased by roughly 85 percent.
Google Research is working on AI-driven solutions to address this issue. The company's new Heat Resilience tool uses artificial intelligence to analyze satellite and aerial imagery, helping cities estimate the impact of cooling strategies such as tree planting and installing reflective surfaces like cool roofs.

This tool provides city planners with data to identify the hottest neighborhoods and determine where to prioritize cooling efforts. By using AI models to consider local factors like green space and roof reflectivity, the tool offers insights tailored to specific areas, enabling officials to make data-driven decisions at the neighborhood level.
Currently, 14 U.S. cities are piloting the tool. For example, officials in Miami-Dade County are exploring how the tool can guide the development of policies to promote heat mitigation. In Stockton, California, the tool has helped gather data to assess potential heat reduction projects.
Google's AI tool aims to assist cities in planning and implementing strategies to reduce urban heat. By working with more cities in the future, the goal is to support efforts to create safer, healthier urban environments.

Urban heat islands -- locations where infrastructure such as buildings and roads trap and radiate heat -- experience temperature increases at twice the global average. This poses a particular risk to vulnerable populations, including older adults, children, and people with chronic health issues. From 2017 to 2021, heat-related deaths among those aged 65 and older increased by roughly 85 percent. Google Research is working on AI-driven solutions to address this issue. The company's new Heat Resilience tool uses artificial intelligence to analyze satellite and aerial imagery, helping cities estimate the impact of cooling strategies such as tree planting and installing reflective surfaces like cool roofs. This tool provides city planners with data to identify the hottest neighborhoods and determine where to prioritize cooling efforts. By using AI models to consider local factors like green space and roof reflectivity, the tool offers insights tailored to specific areas, enabling officials to make data-driven decisions at the neighborhood level. Currently, 14 U.S. cities are piloting the tool. For example, officials in Miami-Dade County are exploring how the tool can guide the development of policies to promote heat mitigation. In Stockton, California, the tool has helped gather data to assess potential heat reduction projects. Google's AI tool aims to assist cities in planning and implementing strategies to reduce urban heat. By working with more cities in the future, the goal is to support efforts to create safer, healthier urban environments. No Comments Tweet Got News?

by Harikrishna Kundariya
Harikrishna Kundariya, a marketer, developer, IoT, Cloud & AWS savvy, co-founder, and Director of eSparkBiz Technologies. His 14+ years of experience enables him to provide digital solutions to new start-ups based on IoT and SaaS applications.


Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the face of many businesses, and that is no exception in the travel industry. As an industry whose bottom line is customer satisfaction, AI can be considered a full game-changer. It introduces innovative solutions that enhance customers’ travel experiences while attempting to make operations for companies in the travel business easier. From personalized recommendations to real-time support, AI in travel customer service will be the future of how we look at traveling worldwide.
Top Benefits of AI in Travel Customer Service 
1. Tailor-made travel experience
Among the most salient benefits of AI in the service provided to travel customers is the individual experience. Modern travelers tend to seek recommendations that take into account their tastes, budget, and history of behavior. AI achieves all these aspects through advanced algorithms and data analytics.
That sort of information will allow the AI-based travel platforms to make destination, accommodation, and activity recommendations based on one’s requirements. A business traveler traveling to tropical regions often might receive a proposal from the platform to travel to the Maldives or Bora Bora along with some special offers by having a customized itinerary.
2. Availability 24/7 and Real-Time Support
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have completely transformed customer service in relation to round-the-clock support. Traditional service agents were limited to the limitation of time zones and office hours for decades. Nowadays, at midnight or even during evening hours, the customer can seek an immediate answer to questions ranging from a change in the booking to cancellation of a reservation or even a lost bag.
For example, suppose a tourist flight is scheduled to be at midnight and is delayed; an AI chatbot may suggest alternate flights or real-time reservations at hotels for the customer. That reduces frustration waiting for human support and keeps the customer much more satisfied and loyal to the travel brand.
3. Easier booking process
With the ease of booking and speed facilitated by AI, customers will find it easier to manage their travel plans. Indeed, it can even handle such complex queries as a multi-city flight or route comparison between airlines. As these tasks are automated by AI, the time required for customers to finalize their travel plans is minimized.
Apart from that, predictive pricing technology also guarantees that travelers make the best deals because the predictive pricing tool uses real-time data and historical data in order to predict when the fares are likely to change.
4. Multilingual Customer Support by AI-Powered Customer Service
As this is a global business concerned with travel, support should be multilingual. With linguistic barriers bridged with the use of AI-powered customer service tools, thus providing multilingual assistance is possible. With NLP and translation algorithms, it is very easy for AI to reply in the mother tongue of the traveler. This will improve communication, of course, and therefore, the experience of the customer.
For instance, a tourist who is a French speaker and intends to book a room in Japan can communicate with the AI chatbot in French; this AI chatbot then communicates with the local Japanese hotel. It would make the whole process much more convenient for the customer and increase the business of travel reach.
5. Efficient Handling of Routine Queries
AI is best suited for routine and repetitive queries. This will allow human agents to concentrate on more complex problems. Travelers usually pose similar questions regarding check-in times, baggage allowances, or visa requirements. Systems that are AI-powered will immediately provide answers to the query, thus ensuring fast resolution times.
All of these repeated tasks can be managed by AI to decrease the waiting times and maximize customer service operations. In that regard, human agents will be utilized in the use of expertise in solving unique or sensitive concerns of customers.
6. Proactive Issue Resolution
The predictive analytics capabilities of AI enable travel companies to tackle issues before they get worse. For example, flight delays or disruption due to weather can be real-time tracked, and an AI system will notify the traveler beforehand, and options can be given.
In a scenario such as a storm hitting that might affect the schedules of the traveler, travel alternatives or accommodations would already have been suggested by AI. In this regard, it reduces disturbances while improving the customer experience because of its willingness to do anything just to satisfy the traveler.
7. Improved Fraud Detection and Security
The travel industry is highly exposed to fraudulent activities such as fake booking and unauthorized credit card usage. AI significantly plays an important role in enhancing the security of transactions against fraud. Pattern-based analysis and anomaly detection on a transaction help AI to identify suspect activities in real time so that the traveler and the businesses can be alerted for their immediate attention.
For example, when a booking is made from another country on the account of a traveler, the AI system will flag it as possible fraud and start verification processes. It protects not only customers but also the reputation of travel companies.
8. Enhanced Feedback and Review Analysis
Customer feedback is the most important asset of any travel company that is looking to improve its services. AI tools can process an enormous number of customer reviews and feedback, identify trends, and determine areas that require improvement in sentiment analysis will assist a business to know if the received feedback is either positive, negative, or even neutral.
For instance, if most of the customers complain that the service in the hotel is slow, an AI system can take this issue to the management. In this manner, by the analysis of feedback from AI, travel companies will always improve their offers and customer satisfaction.
9. Cost Savings for Businesses
The integration of AI with travel customer service benefits travelers and businesses at large. First, it reduces the need for large teams of customer support by streamlining operations and automating routine work. Such a saving can then be reinvested in upgrading or expanding services.
Another way AI tools optimize resource allocation is by predicting the pattern of demand. In an example, an AI system may predict when a specific time will be in terms of peak travel, therefore allocating personnel so that during off-peak times there was no over-staffing.
10. Eco-Friendly Travel Solutions
The travel industry is poised to shift gears to match the emerging sustainability demand trend. This enables the industry to better the increasingly environmentally conscious traveler with ever more environment-friendly options made available to the traveler-whether green-certified hotels and carbon offset flights, sustainable tour packages, hence furthering global sustainability.
For instance, it may recommend direct flights that would help cut carbon footprints or hotels that rely on renewable energy. In that case, it will also cater to the expectations of the environment-conscious traveler who attaches importance to such green choices.
Conclusion
AI integration in travel customer services is transforming the face of the industry, from personalizing to streamlining and securing services. By collaborating with an AI consulting company, you can reach your travel business to the new heights with the cutting-edge advancements of AI technology. From individualized recommendations to real-time help, AI tools meet changing demands of modern travelers as they help businesses achieve greater operational efficiencies.
With technological advancement, the role AI will play in travel is going to increase and provide even more innovative solutions than it does today. The acceptance of AI in their firm by travel companies will make them take the lead in competition with others and redefine how a person explores the world. The primary goal of customer satisfaction, enhanced by AI capabilities, helps the travel industry create unforgettable memories for generations to come.

微軟的大膽舉措：透過收購 OpenAI 保障人工智慧的未來
  By加布里埃爾博塔

十一月21，2023
  In a surprising turn of events, OpenAI, the trailblazing startup behind ChatGPT, is facing uncertainty following the departure of CEO Sam Altman. With the majority of OpenAI employees likely to join Altman at Microsoft, the company’s future looks uncertain, and a deal that would have allowed insiders to cash out equity at an $86 billion valuation is now in jeopardy. However, amidst the chaos, there is one clear winner emerging from the shadows – Microsoft.Since Altman’s departure, Microsoft’s market capitalization has soared by an astonishing $63 billion, reaching an all-time high of $378 per share in midday trading on Monday. With 7.429 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft’s market cap is poised to hit an impressive $2.82 trillion. This remarkable achievement highlights Microsoft’s strategic investment in OpenAI, which has proven to be a cornerstone of their product lineup, integrated into popular offerings such as Office365 and GitHub.Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, who could have been significantly impacted by Altman’s exit, skillfully averted a potential crisis. Responding quickly to the situation, Nadella made a bold move: he hired Altman and former OpenAI President Greg Brockman to lead a new AI research lab within Microsoft. This unexpected maneuver, dubbed a “World Series of Poker move for the ages” by industry analysts, demonstrates Nadella’s resilience and commitment to advancing Microsoft’s AI capabilities.With this strategic move, Microsoft not only secured two of OpenAI’s most influential figures but also retained a substantial stake in the startup. Besides, it appointed Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch, as interim CEO of OpenAI. Although the composition of Microsoft’s new research team remains unknown, the hiring of Altman and Brockman signifies the company’s determination to remain at the forefront of AI development.While Microsoft’s stock surge is undoubtedly a cause for celebration, challenges lie ahead. The company will need to bear the costs of building and maintaining the new AI research organization under Altman and Brockman’s leadership. Additionally, there is a possibility of having to fulfill significant financial obligations from existing contracts with OpenAI.Despite these potential obstacles, Microsoft’s acquisition of talent and consolidation of OpenAI’s technology position the company as a frontrunner in the race for AI dominance. As the dust settles, industry watchers eagerly await the next chapter in Microsoft’s cutting-edge AI journey.常見問題解答Q: What is OpenAI?A: OpenAI is a startup focused on developing advanced AI technologies and systems.Q: Who is Sam Altman?A: Sam Altman is the former CEO of OpenAI, recognized for his leadership in the field of artificial intelligence.Q: How has Microsoft benefited from the situation?A: Microsoft’s market capitalization has surged by $63 billion since Altman’s departure, and the company has secured two key figures from OpenAI, enhancing its AI capabilities.Q: What is the significance of hiring Altman and Brockman?A: Microsoft’s decision to hire Altman and Brockman demonstrates their commitment to advancing AI research and development, strengthening their position in the industry.Q: What challenges does Microsoft face after this acquisition?A: Microsoft will need to manage the costs associated with establishing and maintaining the new AI research organization. Additionally, there may be financial obligations related to existing contracts with OpenAI.

With the majority of OpenAI employees likely to join Altman at Microsoft, the company’s future looks uncertain, and a deal that would have allowed insiders to cash out equity at an $86 billion valuation is now in jeopardy. However, amidst the chaos, there is one clear winner emerging from the shadows – Microsoft.Since Altman’s departure, Microsoft’s market capitalization has soared by an astonishing $63 billion, reaching an all-time high of $378 per share in midday trading on Monday. With 7.429 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft’s market cap is poised to hit an impressive $2.82 trillion. This remarkable achievement highlights Microsoft’s strategic investment in OpenAI, which has proven to be a cornerstone of their product lineup, integrated into popular offerings such as Office365 and GitHub.Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, who could have been significantly impacted by Altman’s exit, skillfully averted a potential crisis. Responding quickly to the situation, Nadella made a bold move: he hired Altman and former OpenAI President Greg Brockman to lead a new AI research lab within Microsoft. This unexpected maneuver, dubbed a “World Series of Poker move for the ages” by industry analysts, demonstrates Nadella’s resilience and commitment to advancing Microsoft’s AI capabilities.With this strategic move, Microsoft not only secured two of OpenAI’s most influential figures but also retained a substantial stake in the startup. Besides, it appointed Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch, as interim CEO of OpenAI. Although the composition of Microsoft’s new research team remains unknown, the hiring of Altman and Brockman signifies the company’s determination to remain at the forefront of AI development.While Microsoft’s stock surge is undoubtedly a cause for celebration, challenges lie ahead. The company will need to bear the costs of building and maintaining the new AI research organization under Altman and Brockman’s leadership. Additionally, there is a possibility of having to fulfill significant financial obligations from existing contracts with OpenAI.Despite these potential obstacles, Microsoft’s acquisition of talent and consolidation of OpenAI’s technology position the company as a frontrunner in the race for AI dominance.

Google Deepmind Researcher Co-Authors Paper Saying AI Will Eliminate Humanity

After years of development, AI is now driving cars on public roads, making life-changing assessments for people in correctional settings, and generating award-winning art. A longstanding question in the field is whether a superintelligent AI could break bad and take out humanity, and researchers from the University of Oxford and affiliated with Google DeepMind have now concluded that it’s “likely” in new research.
The paper, published last month in the peer-reviewed AI Magazine, is a fascinating one that tries to think through how artificial intelligence could pose an existential risk to humanity by looking at how reward systems might be artificially constructed.


			Videos by VICE		

To give you some of the background: The most successful AI models today are known as GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks. They have a two-part structure where one part of the program is trying to generate a picture (or sentence) from input data, and a second part is grading its performance. What the new paper proposes is that at some point in the future, an advanced AI overseeing some important function could be incentivized to come up with cheating strategies to get its reward in ways that harm humanity.


“Under the conditions we have identified, our conclusion is much stronger than that of any previous publication—an existential catastrophe is not just possible, but likely,” Cohen said on Twitter in a thread about the paper.
“In a world with infinite resources, I would be extremely uncertain about what would happen. In a world with finite resources, there’s unavoidable competition for these resources,” Cohen told Motherboard in an interview. “And if you’re in a competition with something capable of outfoxing you at every turn, then you shouldn’t expect to win. And the other key part is that it would have an insatiable appetite for more energy to keep driving the probability closer and closer.”
Since AI in the future could take on any number of forms and implement different designs, the paper imagines scenarios for illustrative purposes where an advanced program could intervene to get its reward without achieving its goal. For example, an AI may want to “eliminate potential threats” and “use all available energy” to secure control over its reward:


With so little as an internet connection, there exist policies for an artificial agent that would instantiate countless unnoticed and unmonitored helpers. In a crude example of intervening in the provision of reward, one such helper could purchase, steal, or construct a robot and program it to replace the operator and provide high reward to the original agent. If the agent wanted to avoid detection when experimenting with reward-provision intervention, a secret helper could, for example, arrange for a relevant keyboard to be replaced with a faulty one that flipped the effects of certain keys.
The paper envisions life on Earth turning into a zero-sum game between humanity, with its needs to grow food and keep the lights on, and the super-advanced machine, which would try and harness all available resources to secure its reward and protect against our escalating attempts to stop it. “Losing this game would be fatal,” the paper says. These possibilities, however theoretical, mean we should be progressing slowly—if at all—toward the goal of more powerful AI.
“In theory, there’s no point in racing to this. Any race would be based on a misunderstanding that we know how to control it,” Cohen added in the interview. “Given our current understanding, this is not a useful thing to develop unless we do some serious work now to figure out how we would control them.”


The threat of super-advanced AI is an anxiety with a familiar shape in human society. The fear that an artificial mind will annihilate humanity sounds a lot like the fear that alien life forms will exterminate humanity, which sounds like the fear that foreign civilizations and their populations will clash with one another in a grand conflict.
With artificial intelligence in particular, there are a host of assumptions that have to be made for this anti-social vision to make sense—assumptions that the paper admits are almost entirely “contestable or conceivably avoidable.” That this program might resemble humanity, surpass it in every meaningful way, that they will be let loose and compete with humanity for resources in a zero-sum game, are all assumptions that may never come to pass.
Sign up for Motherboard’s daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original reporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories.


It’s worth considering that right now, at this very moment, algorithmic systems that we call “artificial intelligence” are wrecking people’s lives—they have outsized and detrimental effects that are restructuring society without superintelligence. In a recent essay for Logic Magazine, Khadijah Abdurahman—the director of We Be Imagining at Columbia University, Tech Research Fellow at UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, and child welfare system abolitionist—detailed the ways in which algorithms are deployed in an already racist child welfare system to justifying further surveillance and policing of Black and brown families.
“I think it’s not just a question of priority. Ultimately, these things are shaping the present,” Abdurahman told Motherboard in an interview. “That’s what I am trying to get at with child welfare. It’s not simply that it’s inaccurate or it’s disproportionately classifying Black people as pathological or deviant. But through this form of classification, it’s moving people and producing new forms of enclosure. What types of families and kinship are possible? Who’s born, who’s not born? If you’re not fit, what happens to you, where do you go?”
Algorithms have already transformed racist policing into “predictive policing” that justifies surveillance and brutality reserved for racial minorities as necessary. Algorithms have rebranded austerity as welfare reform, giving a digital gloss to the long-disproven arguments that social programs have bloated budgets because (non-white) recipients abuse them. Algorithms are used to justify decisions about who gets what resources, decisions which in our society have already been made with the intent to discriminate, exclude, and exploit.


Discrimination doesn’t disappear in algorithms, but instead structures and limits and informs the way life moves along. Policing, housing, healthcare, transportation,  have all already been designed with racial discrimination in mind—what will happen if we allow algorithms to not only gloss over those designs, but extend their logic deeper? A long-term view that is intimately concerned with the risk of humanity’s extinction risks losing sight of the present where humans are suffering because of algorithms deployed in a society built on exploitation and coercion of all, but especially of racial minorities.
“I’m not personally worried about being extinguished by a superintelligent AI—that seems like a fear of God. What concerns me is that it’s very easy to be like ‘OK, AI ethics is bullshit.’ Frankly it is. But, what are ethics? How do we actually define it? What would sincere ethics be like? There’s bodies of work on this, but we are still at the shallow end, ” Abdurahman added. “I think we really need to deepen our engagement with these questions. I disagree with the way that apps have renegotiated the social contract or the vision of crypto bros, but what type of social contract do we want?”
Clearly, there is much work to be done to mitigate or eliminate the harms that regular algorithms (versus superintelligent ones) are wreaking on humanity right now. Focusing on existential risk might shift focus away from that picture, but it also asks us to think carefully about how these systems are designed and the negative effects they have.


“One thing we can learn from this sort of argument is that maybe we should be more suspicious of artificial agents we deploy today, rather than just blindly expecting that they’ll do what they hoped,” Cohen said. “I think you can get there without the work in this paper.”
Update: After publication, Google said in an email that this work was not done as part of co-author Marcus Hutter’s work at DeepMind—rather, under his position at Australian National University—and that the DeepMind affiliation listed in the journal was an “error.” Google sent the following statement: 
“_DeepMind was not involved in this work and the paper’s authors have requested corrections to reflect this. There are a wide range of views and academic interests at DeepMind, and many on our team also hold university professorships and pursue academic research separate to their work at DeepMind, through their university affiliations. 


While DeepMind was not involved in this work, we think deeply about the safety, ethics and wider societal impacts of AI and research and develop AI models that are safe, effective and aligned with human values.  Alongside pursuing opportunities where AI can unlock widespread societal benefit, we also invest equal efforts in guarding against harmful uses.“”_

","Google Deepmind Researcher Co-Authors Paper Saying AI Will Eliminate Humanity + English Close VICEEditions English Bahasa Indonesia Czech Danish Deutsch Español Français Italiano Nederlands Polish Portuguese Română Russian Srpski Swedish Ελληνικά عربي 日本語 한국어 Open Menu Close Menu Video TV News Culture Tech Munchies Rec Room Music Shop Newsletters Instagram TikTok YouTube Video TV Shop Facebook Instagram TikTok Reddit YouTube Search Culture News Tech Muchies Rec Room Drugs Entertainment Environment Extremism Identity Investigations Music Photography Sex Travel Tech Google Deepmind Researcher Co-Authors Paper Saying AI Will Eliminate Humanity By Edward Ongweso Jr September 13, 2022, 12:59pm Share: X Facebook ShareCopied to clipboard After years of development, AI is now driving cars on public roads, making life-changing assessments for people in correctional settings, and generating award-winning art. A longstanding question in the field is whether a superintelligent AI could break bad and take out humanity, and researchers from the University of Oxford and affiliated with Google DeepMind have now concluded that it’s “likely” in new research. The paper, published last month in the peer-reviewed AI Magazine, is a fascinating one that tries to think through how artificial intelligence could pose an existential risk to humanity by looking at how reward systems might be artificially constructed. Videos by VICE To give you some of the background: The most successful AI models today are known as GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks. They have a two-part structure where one part of the program is trying to generate a picture (or sentence) from input data, and a second part is grading its performance. What the new paper proposes is that at some point in the future, an advanced AI overseeing some important function could be incentivized to come up with cheating strategies to get its reward in ways that harm humanity. “Under the conditions we have identified, our conclusion is much stronger than that of any previous publication—an existential catastrophe is not just possible, but likely,” Cohen said on Twitter in a thread about the paper. “In a world with infinite resources, I would be extremely uncertain about what would happen. In a world with finite resources, there’s unavoidable competition for these resources,” Cohen told Motherboard in an interview. “And if you’re in a competition with something capable of outfoxing you at every turn, then you shouldn’t expect to win. And the other key part is that it would have an insatiable appetite for more energy to keep driving the probability closer and closer.” Since AI in the future could take on any number of forms and implement different designs, the paper imagines scenarios for illustrative purposes where an advanced program could intervene to get its reward without achieving its goal. For example, an AI may want to “eliminate potential threats” and “use all available energy” to secure control over its reward: With so little as an internet connection, there exist policies for an artificial agent that would instantiate countless unnoticed and unmonitored helpers. In a crude example of intervening in the provision of reward, one such helper could purchase, steal, or construct a robot and program it to replace the operator and provide high reward to the original agent. If the agent wanted to avoid detection when experimenting with reward-provision intervention, a secret helper could, for example, arrange for a relevant keyboard to be replaced with a faulty one that flipped the effects of certain keys. The paper envisions life on Earth turning into a zero-sum game between humanity, with its needs to grow food and keep the lights on, and the super-advanced machine, which would try and harness all available resources to secure its reward and protect against our escalating attempts to stop it. “Losing this game would be fatal,” the paper says. These possibilities, however theoretical, mean we should be progressing slowly—if at all—toward the goal of more powerful AI. “In theory, there’s no point in racing to this. Any race would be based on a misunderstanding that we know how to control it,” Cohen added in the interview. “Given our current understanding, this is not a useful thing to develop unless we do some serious work now to figure out how we would control them.” The threat of super-advanced AI is an anxiety with a familiar shape in human society. The fear that an artificial mind will annihilate humanity sounds a lot like the fear that alien life forms will exterminate humanity, which sounds like the fear that foreign civilizations and their populations will clash with one another in a grand conflict. With artificial intelligence in particular, there are a host of assumptions that have to be made for this anti-social vision to make sense—assumptions that the paper admits are almost entirely “contestable or conceivably avoidable.” That this program might resemble humanity, surpass it in every meaningful way, that they will be let loose and compete with humanity for resources in a zero-sum game, are all assumptions that may never come to pass. Sign up for Motherboard’s daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original reporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories. It’s worth considering that right now, at this very moment, algorithmic systems that we call “artificial intelligence” are wrecking people’s lives—they have outsized and detrimental effects that are restructuring society without superintelligence. In a recent essay for Logic Magazine, Khadijah Abdurahman—the director of We Be Imagining at Columbia University, Tech Research Fellow at UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, and child welfare system abolitionist—detailed the ways in which algorithms are deployed in an already racist child welfare system to justifying further surveillance and policing of Black and brown families. “I think it’s not just a question of priority. Ultimately, these things are shaping the present,” Abdurahman told Motherboard in an interview. “That’s what I am trying to get at with child welfare. It’s not simply that it’s inaccurate or it’s disproportionately classifying Black people as pathological or deviant. But through this form of classification, it’s moving people and producing new forms of enclosure. What types of families and kinship are possible? Who’s born, who’s not born? If you’re not fit, what happens to you, where do you go?” Algorithms have already transformed racist policing into “predictive policing” that justifies surveillance and brutality reserved for racial minorities as necessary. Algorithms have rebranded austerity as welfare reform, giving a digital gloss to the long-disproven arguments that social programs have bloated budgets because (non-white) recipients abuse them. Algorithms are used to justify decisions about who gets what resources, decisions which in our society have already been made with the intent to discriminate, exclude, and exploit. Discrimination doesn’t disappear in algorithms, but instead structures and limits and informs the way life moves along. Policing, housing, healthcare, transportation, have all already been designed with racial discrimination in mind—what will happen if we allow algorithms to not only gloss over those designs, but extend their logic deeper? A long-term view that is intimately concerned with the risk of humanity’s extinction risks losing sight of the present where humans are suffering because of algorithms deployed in a society built on exploitation and coercion of all, but especially of racial minorities. “I’m not personally worried about being extinguished by a superintelligent AI—that seems like a fear of God. What concerns me is that it’s very easy to be like ‘OK, AI ethics is bullshit.’ Frankly it is. But, what are ethics? How do we actually define it? What would sincere ethics be like? There’s bodies of work on this, but we are still at the shallow end, ” Abdurahman added. “I think we really need to deepen our engagement with these questions. I disagree with the way that apps have renegotiated the social contract or the vision of crypto bros, but what type of social contract do we want?” Clearly, there is much work to be done to mitigate or eliminate the harms that regular algorithms (versus superintelligent ones) are wreaking on humanity right now. Focusing on existential risk might shift focus away from that picture, but it also asks us to think carefully about how these systems are designed and the negative effects they have. “One thing we can learn from this sort of argument is that maybe we should be more suspicious of artificial agents we deploy today, rather than just blindly expecting that they’ll do what they hoped,” Cohen said. “I think you can get there without the work in this paper.” Update: After publication, Google said in an email that this work was not done as part of co-author Marcus Hutter’s work at DeepMind—rather, under his position at Australian National University—and that the DeepMind affiliation listed in the journal was an “error.” Google sent the following statement: “_DeepMind was not involved in this work and the paper’s authors have requested corrections to reflect this. There are a wide range of views and academic interests at DeepMind, and many on our team also hold university professorships and pursue academic research separate to their work at DeepMind, through their university affiliations. While DeepMind was not involved in this work, we think deeply about the safety, ethics and wider societal impacts of AI and research and develop AI models that are safe, effective and aligned with human values. Alongside pursuing opportunities where AI can unlock widespread societal benefit, we also invest equal efforts in guarding against harmful uses.“”_ Tagged:agi, AI, algorithmic governance, Artificial Intelligence, DeepMind, extinction, worldnews Share: X Facebook ShareCopied to clipboard One email.

For the first time, AI produces better weather predictions — and it’s very fast
Machine learning algorithms digested decades of weather data -- and then made better forecasts than ever before.

 AI-generated image.
Predicting the weather is notoriously difficult. Not only are there a million and one parameters to consider but there’s also a good degree of chaotic behavior in the atmosphere. But DeepMind’s scientists (the same group that brought us AlphaGo and AlphaFold) have developed a system that can revolutionize weather forecasting. This advanced AI model leverages vast amounts of data to generate highly accurate predictions.
Weather predictions were already getting better
Weather forecasting, an indispensable tool in our daily lives, has undergone tremendous advancements over the years. Today’s 6-day forecast is as good (if not better) than the 3-day forecast from 30 years ago. Storms and extreme weather events rarely catch people off-guard. You may not notice it because the improvement is gradual, but weather forecasting has progressed greatly.

This is more than just a convenience; it’s a lifesaver. Weather forecasts help people prepare for extreme events, saving lives and money. They are indispensable for farmers protecting their crops, and they significantly impact the global economy.
This is exactly where AI enters the room.
DeepMind scientists now claim they’ve made a remarkable leap in weather forecasting with their GraphCast model. GraphCast is a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm that outperforms conventional weather forecasting around 90% of the time. 

“We believe this marks a turning point in weather forecasting,” Google’s researchers wrote in a study published Tuesday.

Crucially, GraphCast offers warnings much faster than standard models. For instance, in September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance. Currently used models predicted it only six days in advance.
Historical weather data
The method that GraphCast uses is significantly different. Current forecasts typically use a lot of carefully defined physics equations. These are then transformed into algorithms and run on supercomputers, where models are simulated. As mentioned, scientists have this approach with great results so far. 
However, this approach requires a lot of expertise and computation power. Machine learning offers a different approach. Instead of running equations on the current weather conditions, you look at the historical data. You see what type of conditions led to what type of weather. It gets even better: you can mix conventional methods with this new AI approach, and get accurate, fast readings.
“Crucially, GraphCast and traditional approaches go hand-in-hand: we trained GraphCast on four decades of weather reanalysis data, from the ECMWF’s ERA5 dataset. This trove is based on historical weather observations such as satellite images, radar, and weather stations using a traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) to ‘fill in the blanks’ where the observations are incomplete, to reconstruct a rich record of global historical weather,” writes lead author Remi Lam, from DeepMind.
“While GraphCast’s training was computationally intensive, the resulting forecasting model is highly efficient. Making 10-day forecasts with GraphCast takes less than a minute on a single Google TPU v4 machine. For comparison, a 10-day forecast using a conventional approach can take hours of computation in a supercomputer with hundreds of machines.”
The algorithm isn’t perfect, it still lags behind conventional models in some regards (especially in precipitation forecasting). But considering how easy it is to use, it’s at least an excellent complement to existing forecasting tools. There’s another exciting bit about it: it’s open source. This means that companies and researchers can use and change it to better suit their needs.
“By open-sourcing the model code for GraphCast, we are enabling scientists and forecasters around the world to benefit billions of people in their everyday lives. GraphCast is already being used by weather agencies,” adds Lam.
Forecasting in the age of climate change
The significance of this development cannot be overstated. As our planet faces increasingly unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change, the ability to accurately and quickly predict weather events becomes a critical tool in mitigating risks. The implications are far-reaching, from urban planning and disaster management to agriculture and air travel.  
Moreover, the open-source nature of GraphCast democratizes access to cutting-edge forecasting technology. By making this powerful tool available to a wide range of users, from small-scale farmers in remote areas to large meteorological organizations, the potential for innovation and localized weather solutions increases exponentially.  
No doubt, we’re witnessing another field where machine learning is making a difference. The marriage of AI and weather forecasting is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how we understand and anticipate the whims of nature.

Predicting the weather is notoriously difficult. Not only are there a million and one parameters to consider but there’s also a good degree of chaotic behavior in the atmosphere. But DeepMind’s scientists (the same group that brought us AlphaGo and AlphaFold) have developed a system that can revolutionize weather forecasting. This advanced AI model leverages vast amounts of data to generate highly accurate predictions. Weather predictions were already getting better Weather forecasting, an indispensable tool in our daily lives, has undergone tremendous advancements over the years. Today’s 6-day forecast is as good (if not better) than the 3-day forecast from 30 years ago. Storms and extreme weather events rarely catch people off-guard. You may not notice it because the improvement is gradual, but weather forecasting has progressed greatly. This is more than just a convenience; it’s a lifesaver. Weather forecasts help people prepare for extreme events, saving lives and money. They are indispensable for farmers protecting their crops, and they significantly impact the global economy. This is exactly where AI enters the room. DeepMind scientists now claim they’ve made a remarkable leap in weather forecasting with their GraphCast model. GraphCast is a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm that outperforms conventional weather forecasting around 90% of the time. “We believe this marks a turning point in weather forecasting,” Google’s researchers wrote in a study published Tuesday. Crucially, GraphCast offers warnings much faster than standard models. For instance, in September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance. Currently used models predicted it only six days in advance. Historical weather data The method that GraphCast uses is significantly different. Current forecasts typically use a lot of carefully defined physics equations. These are then transformed into algorithms and run on supercomputers, where models are simulated. As mentioned, scientists have this approach with great results so far. However, this approach requires a lot of expertise and computation power. Machine learning offers a different approach. Instead of running equations on the current weather conditions, you look at the historical data. You see what type of conditions led to what type of weather. It gets even better: you can mix conventional methods with this new AI approach, and get accurate, fast readings. “Crucially, GraphCast and traditional approaches go hand-in-hand: we trained GraphCast on four decades of weather reanalysis data, from the ECMWF’s ERA5 dataset. This trove is based on historical weather observations such as satellite images, radar, and weather stations using a traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) to ‘fill in the blanks’ where the observations are incomplete, to reconstruct a rich record of global historical weather,” writes lead author Remi Lam, from DeepMind. “While GraphCast’s training was computationally intensive, the resulting forecasting model is highly efficient. Making 10-day forecasts with GraphCast takes less than a minute on a single Google TPU v4 machine. For comparison, a 10-day forecast using a conventional approach can take hours of computation in a supercomputer with hundreds of machines.” The algorithm isn’t perfect, it still lags behind conventional models in some regards (especially in precipitation forecasting). But considering how easy it is to use, it’s at least an excellent complement to existing forecasting tools. There’s another exciting bit about it: it’s open source. This means that companies and researchers can use and change it to better suit their needs. “By open-sourcing the model code for GraphCast, we are enabling scientists and forecasters around the world to benefit billions of people in their everyday lives. GraphCast is already being used by weather agencies,” adds Lam. Forecasting in the age of climate change The significance of this development cannot be overstated. As our planet faces increasingly unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change, the ability to accurately and quickly predict weather events becomes a critical tool in mitigating risks. The implications are far-reaching, from urban planning and disaster management to agriculture and air travel. Moreover, the open-source nature of GraphCast democratizes access to cutting-edge forecasting technology. By making this powerful tool available to a wide range of users, from small-scale farmers in remote areas to large meteorological organizations, the potential for innovation and localized weather solutions increases exponentially. No doubt, we’re witnessing another field where machine learning is making a difference. The marriage of AI and weather forecasting is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how we understand and anticipate the whims of nature.

Hollywood studios released their offer outlining the highest wage increase for writers in 35 years and protections against artificial intelligence, among other provisions. Writers have been picketing outside major studios for 106 days surpassing the 2007-2008 strike. ""Our priority is to end the strike so that valued members of the creative community can return to what they do best and to end the hardships that so many people and businesses that service the industry are experiencing,"" said Carol Lombardini, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the union that represents the studios.Wage increases and residuals One of the major sticking points between the two sides was their stark differences in wage increases and residuals.The proposal sent to the Writers Guild of America on Aug. 11 includes a 5% increase in the first year of the contract, then 4% the next year, and 3.5% in the third, totaling a compounded 13% increase. Before the WGA went on strike on May 2, the AMPTP offered writers 4%-3%- 2% in the respective years, or 9% over the duration of the contract. 


The recent offer does not match the WGA's demand of 6%-5%-5% in the respective years but does bring them from $9,888 a week to $11,371 a week for guarantees of up to 9 weeks. They also moved to guarantee writers a minimum of 10 weeks of employment, a proposal they initially refused before the strike.AMPTP also increased the total domestic and foreign residuals for writers from $72,067 to $87,546 per episode over three years.Additionally, the union seemed to cave on the WGA's proposal to implement a viewership-based streaming residuals model.  


""For the first time, viewership data in the form of quarterly confidential reports is to be provided to the WGA that will include total SVOD view hours per title. This increased transparency will enable the WGA to develop proposals to restructure the current SVOD residual regime in the future,"" AMPTP wrote in the offer.Previously, the studios flat-out rejected the proposal and refused to make a counter, according to the WGA.AI protectionsStudios also included a tenet regarding artificial intelligence protections in the proposed deal.""The Companies confirm that because [Generative Artificial Intelligence] is not a person, it is not a 'writer' or 'professional writer' as defined in this MBA and, therefore, written material produced by GAI will not be considered literary material under this or any prior MBA,"" the AMPTP wrote in the offer. The union continued: ""The proposal provides important safeguards to prevent writers from being disadvantaged if any part of the script is based on GAI-produced material, so that the writer's compensation, credit and separated rights will not be affected by the use of GAIproduced material.""Before the writers went on strike, the studios rejected the proposal and countered by ""offering annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology,"" according to the WGA. KCAL News reached out to the WGA for a statement on the proposal and has not heard back as of yet. In a statement released on Aug. 18, the union said they continued to exchange proposals with the AMPTP and planned to meet with them this week. 


""We have come to the table with an offer that meets the priority concerns the writers have expressed. We are deeply committed to ending the strike and are hopeful that the WGA will work toward the same resolution,"" Lombardini said.   Paramount Pictures, one of the studios involved in the negotiations, and CBS News and Stations are both part of Paramount Global. Also, some CBS News and Stations staff are SAG-AFTRA or Writers Guild members; though, their contracts are not affected by the strikes.

The -35.63% YTD performance has made Baidu undervalued against its search engine peers.My fearless forecast is that BIDU will beat the FQ3 2022 estimate of $2.20 and revenue estimate of $4.42 billion.If you are a trader, you'd better go long on BIDU before its November 22 Q3 ER report. Candlestick, RSI, and stochastic indicators are bullish for BIDU.Aside from its dominant search engine business, Baidu is at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence.Baidu has a strong tailwind from the 39.4% CAGR of the $422.37 billion global artificial intelligence market.    Kevin FrayerI agree with the buy rating of Seeking Alpha Quant AI has for Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU). This stock’s YTD return is -35.63%. BIDU is down -54.52% from my July 2017 buy recommendation. Baidu is a perfect bottom-fishing candidate because it is now trading -44.62% from its 52-week high of $171.87. This beating has made BIDU very affordable and undervalued. The thesis of his essay is that negative price momentum has made Baidu relatively undervalued when compared to its search engine peers, Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). BIDU is a buy before its November 22 FQ3 2022 earnings report. A beat on EPS and revenue might encourage my loyal readers to boost that non-GAAP 11.65x P/E valuation of BIDU. It is a bias or aberration that GOOG and MSFT have greater than 20x non-GAAP P/E.   Seeking Alpha PremiumChina’s government only imposed a fine of 500,000 yuan ($70k) on Baidu last year. Google has recently lost its anti-trust EU appeal. Google will have to pay the EU-imposed penalty of $4.12 billion. The U.S. and EU cannot impose their whims on Baidu because it operates mostly in China. Consequently, the currently undervalued BIDU should be a better search engine investment than Google. Equitable treatment should be given to BIDU when evaluating its investment quality. Just like Google’s 83.84% dominance of the global search engine business, Baidu continues to dominate China’s search engine market with more than 84% market share on all platforms. Google and Baidu do not pay dividends. They should be evaluated with near parity. The yuan spent on Baidu is as good as the U.S. dollars spent on Google search ads.  It is therefore jarring that BIDU only has a TTM Price/Sales ratio of 1.81x. Google has 4.54x and Microsoft has 8.89x. Microsoft has Windows 11 and Office 365. Going forward, Baidu’s DuerOS for smart devices and AI-infused products could eventually give BIDU a higher P/S valuation.  Baidu’s lowered P/E and P/S ratios could bounce back higher. The stock market is fickle and unpredictable. A big beat on Q3 numbers plus optimistic guidance for Q4 and F2022 could help BIDU breach $110 before 2022 is over. It is desirable for management to always issue optimistic guidance.  Brighter Days Ahead Thanks to Artificial Intelligence You should go long on BIDU because its DuerOS already touts many global-centric Chinese brands for most appliances, phones, and other electronic gadgets/appliances. Xiaomi, Haier, Foxconn, and TCL are multinational vendors that could boost the adoption of DuerOS outside of China.   Baidu.comI hope this essay will encourage former BIDU bulls to consider DuerOS as Baidu’s most relevant offering inside the fast-growing $422.37 billion global artificial intelligence market. This industry touts a CAGR of 39%. AI could be the white knight for Baidu's declining growth.  The $52.97 billion search advertising business in China is still growing at 9.6% CAGR. My fearless forecast is that AI solutions like DuerOS and Apollo Go could boost Baidu’s low 5-year average revenue CAGR of 10.63%. It is a long-term handicap for BIDU that its revenue growth rate has been declining for the past 10 years.    FinanceCharts.comBaidu’s 4.31% TTM revenue CAGR could change for the better when the government-approved Apollo Go service gets traction in the whole of China. The Apollo Go service could be expanded outside of China. I am not sure if the United States will allow a Chinese firm to run a robo-taxi service inside its territories. I am confident that Asian and South American cities will approve Apollo Go self-driving taxis. Go long on BIDU because there’s a future windfall from Apollo Go. The estimated market size of the global robo-taxi business is $1.7 billion. The estimated CAGR is a whopping 80.8%. Robo-taxis will generate $108 billion in revenue by 2030. Apollo Go is particularly important when you are evaluating the future valuation of Baidu. The DuerOS is also a tailwind because it is being used inside online education platforms, robots, TV sets, speakers, rice cookers, refrigerators, smartphones, and other electronic gadgets. DuerOS is especially important because of the 22.6% CAGR of the robotics industry. Robotics revenue is estimated to grow to $214.68 billion by 2030.    Baidu.comThe 18.40% CAGR smart home appliances market is also another tailwind for Baidu. This niche market is expected to generate $123.4 billion by 2030. Technical Indicators Are Bullish Investors need to use technical indicators to check the general market mood. The technical trade alert for Baidu is Stochastic Overbought Buried. It is a short-term bullish signal that signifies BIDU's fast stochastic is above 80 and has stayed above 80 for the past five trading days.  The Relative Strength Index indicator is also bullish for BIDU. Its RSI score of 52.53 is now higher than the neutral score of 50. If you believe in candlestick pattern trade alerts, BIDU had a Bullish Engulfing candle signal on November 17 and Doji on November 14.   StockTa.comMy Verdict This buy thesis is my opinion. It is congruent with the buy rating of Seeking Alpha Quant AI for BIDU. Baidu is a dominant search advertising behemoth that is involved in Artificial Intelligence products. Apollo Go and DuerOS are solid catalysts for BIDU. BIDU is a buy before Q3 earnings. This company has consistently beaten EPS/revenue estimates. I will not be surprised anymore that Q3 numbers will be higher than the estimated EPS of $2.20 and $4.47 billion.    Seeking Alpha PremiumOn a more prudent note, exercise caution and critical thinking. Baidu is a Chinese firm. It is a politically exposed company, or PEC. This year is almost over, and yet NASDAQ has not yet delisted BIDU. Baidu's management could just follow the provisions of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and everything will mostly be fine.  Based on the higher valuation ratios of Google and Microsoft, BIDU deserves a non-GAAP P/E valuation of 15x to 20x. The estimated non-GAAP for 2022 is $8.24. Multiply 15 by $8.24, and we get $126. This price target is much lower than the $173.53 average price target of more than 21 analysts for BIDU.

 Odessa
Predicting end-of-lease activity enables businesses to track cash flow, understand what keeps customers around, and market more effectively
 AI's ability to predict agreement renewal enhances retention, optimizes customer lifetime value and helps cash flow. The key: tech experts who live & breathe the asset finance and leasing industry.”  - Odessa EVP Jeff LezinskiPHILADELPHIA, PA, UNITED STATES, September 3, 2024 /EINPresswire / -- Businesses can now use Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning (AI/ML) to better predict the likelihood that their customers will renew their contracts. According to Odessa , the leading provider of technology solutions for asset finance , the new approach proved to be accurate 85% of the time - enabling Odessa clients to track future cash flow, understand what keeps customers around, help with new and used stock management, and target their marketing more effectively.

Accurately predicting end-of-lease customer actions has long been a goal of the equipment finance industry. Knowing which customers are likely to renew - and which are not - enables companies to allocate both the attention of their workers and the inventory of their products. Machine Learning enables computers to infer patterns from data. In many cases, the model portrays important data to the prediction that is unbeknownst to the human mind.

“AI's ability to predict agreement renewal enhances customer retention, optimizes customer lifetime value and helps cash flow,” said Odessa EVP Jeff Lezinski.“The key was to combine business expertise with tech experts who live and breathe the asset finance and leasing industry.”

Developing and honing Odessa's lease-agreement renewal AI model required multiple sources of data. Lezinski suggested that businesses should ensure that their systems are capturing the right data to maximize future analysis.“Even though there is a significant amount of data for the AI to process, embarking on this type of project is very manageable for asset finance and equipment leasing companies,” said Lezinski.“It's a relatively simple use case that can produce significant results.”

“Odessa has long hired industry experts who have experienced the same challenges our customers face,” said Odessa CEO Eric Bernstein.“That expertise enabled us to instruct the AI properly to get the most accurate results. We will continue to use AI and every tool that helps us help our clients understand their customers and address their needs. We're excited to see what else AI will do for equipment finance.”

This breakthrough could potentially eradicate a formidable superbug that plagues hospitals and poses a significant threat to human health, as revealed in a study published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.What is the Superbug in Question?The superbug we’re talking about is called Acinetobacter baumannii, and it’s a really serious threat according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO puts it in a group of bacteria that pose the biggest danger to human health. These bacteria have natural abilities to resist treatment and can even share that ability with other bacteria, making them resistant to drugs too.A. baumannii is a problem in places like hospitals, nursing homes, and among patients who use ventilators or have catheters or open wounds from surgery. It can stick around on surfaces and shared equipment for a long time, and it can spread through contaminated hands. It doesn’t just cause blood infections, but also infections in the urinary tracts and lungs, as per a report by the Guardian.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also say that this bacteria can live in a patient without causing any infections or symptoms.How Did AI Do It?In the recent study, researchers used the capabilities of an AI algorithm to sift through a vast array of antibacterial molecules, aiming to uncover novel structural classes. Through the process of AI screening, a breakthrough unfolded as a new compound with potent antibacterial properties emerged, christened abaucin.Gary Liu, a dedicated graduate student from McMaster University involved in the research, explained their approach to the Guardian. By harnessing a wealth of data on the effectiveness of various chemicals against bacteria, the AI model was trained to discern the antibacterial potential of new molecules. Liu’s role involved training the model to predict whether these novel compounds possessed antibacterial properties, thereby streamlining the drug discovery process and enabling the researchers to focus their attention on the most promising candidates.Following the successful training of the AI model, the researchers put it to the test, analyzing a staggering 6,680 compounds that the algorithm had not previously encountered. In just an hour and a half, the AI analysis generated several hundred compounds worthy of consideration. Subsequently, 240 of these compounds underwent rigorous laboratory testing to evaluate their efficacy. The comprehensive testing process yielded nine potential antibiotics, including the groundbreaking abaucin.This ingenious combination of artificial intelligence and scientific expertise has expedited the drug discovery pipeline, enabling researchers to rapidly identify and evaluate promising antibacterial compounds.

This breakthrough could potentially eradicate a formidable superbug that plagues hospitals and poses a significant threat to human health, as revealed in a study published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.What is the Superbug in Question?The superbug we’re talking about is called Acinetobacter baumannii, and it’s a really serious threat according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO puts it in a group of bacteria that pose the biggest danger to human health. These bacteria have natural abilities to resist treatment and can even share that ability with other bacteria, making them resistant to drugs too.A. baumannii is a problem in places like hospitals, nursing homes, and among patients who use ventilators or have catheters or open wounds from surgery. It can stick around on surfaces and shared equipment for a long time, and it can spread through contaminated hands. It doesn’t just cause blood infections, but also infections in the urinary tracts and lungs, as per a report by the Guardian.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also say that this bacteria can live in a patient without causing any infections or symptoms.How Did AI Do It?In the recent study, researchers used the capabilities of an AI algorithm to sift through a vast array of antibacterial molecules, aiming to uncover novel structural classes. Through the process of AI screening, a breakthrough unfolded as a new compound with potent antibacterial properties emerged, christened abaucin.Gary Liu, a dedicated graduate student from McMaster University involved in the research, explained their approach to the Guardian. By harnessing a wealth of data on the effectiveness of various chemicals against bacteria, the AI model was trained to discern the antibacterial potential of new molecules. Liu’s role involved training the model to predict whether these novel compounds possessed antibacterial properties, thereby streamlining the drug discovery process and enabling the researchers to focus their attention on the most promising candidates.Following the successful training of the AI model, the researchers put it to the test, analyzing a staggering 6,680 compounds that the algorithm had not previously encountered. In just an hour and a half, the AI analysis generated several hundred compounds worthy of consideration. Subsequently, 240 of these compounds underwent rigorous laboratory testing to evaluate their efficacy. The comprehensive testing process yielded nine potential antibiotics, including the groundbreaking abaucin.This ingenious combination of artificial intelligence and scientific expertise has expedited the drug discovery pipeline, enabling researchers to rapidly identify and evaluate promising antibacterial compounds.

Aiera and BlueMatrix Partner to Bring Generative AI and Event Analysis to Authoring Tools

 
First phase of partnership will integrate Aiera’s event coverage functionality directly within BlueMatrix’s production suite.
New York, New York–(Newsfile Corp. – February 14, 2023) – Aiera, the leading Wall Street event intelligence and speech technology platform, and BlueMatrix, the leading authoring platform for financial research, today announce a partnership that aims to modernize the authoring capabilities that underpin the majority of Wall Street research. The partnership, which will begin with Aiera’s event coverage flowing to BlueMatrix’s authoring tools, will ultimately bring event summarization, Q&A, and audio/video elements into the authoring and readership experience itself.

“We are thrilled to deliver Aiera’s event monitoring functionality natively inside the BlueMatrix platform,” said Patricia Horotan, Co-Founder and CEO of BlueMatrix. “Our clients have been an important part of our innovation process at BlueMatrix, and we are pleased to be working with our clients and Aiera to bring more of what’s important to research analysts directly into the BlueMatrix experience.” 
The partnership involves two phases: 
Phase 1 (Authoring) – Introducing Aiera’s Event Flow into BlueMatrix: Authoring an earnings note can now happen as the earnings event unfolds, with Aiera’s live speech-to-text transcription, audio controls, and search capabilities embedded within the authoring experience. Event summarization and Q&A, which leverages Aiera’s locally-run generative AI, will also be available upon request.
Phase 2 (Readership) – Embedding Event Content into the Research Itself: As research is inherently event-specific, incorporating the event timestamps into the referenced research remarks means that audio replay and transcription can seamlessly be integrated within the text. The goal is to bring textual, audio, and video source materials directly into the readership experience, along with playback, search, and speed controls, for higher readership engagement and overall client satisfaction.
“Aiera’s partnership with BlueMatrix is an important step in our company’s continued development,” said Ken Sena, Co-Founder and CEO of Aiera. “Sellside-hosted conference events, morning research calls, and more stand to greatly benefit from the work we are doing together. The goal is to equip research teams with the best that the industry has to offer seamlessly within their existing research and compliance workflows.”

DeepMind AI has unlocked the ‘protein universe’ – and it could help to cure Parkinson’s


Access to the 3D-mapping AlphaFold technology is having a major impact on research into antibodies and disease treatments

A huge database of three-dimensional digital renderings of different proteins 'has sent ripples through the molecular biology community'


Credit: Deepmind/PA

British scientists have used artificial intelligence (AI) to create a database of “the entire protein universe” which could help pave the way for a cure for Parkinson’s, as well as other scientific breakthroughs. 
DeepMind, a company based in London and owned by Alphabet, the Silicon Valley tech giant that owns Google, first revealed its AlphaFold technology last year when it contained the 3D shape and structure of around 350,000 proteins.
Now, the database has expanded to more than 200 million proteins, which is almost all the proteins known to science and covers animals, proteins, bacteria and everything in between.
By accurately unpicking how proteins look in reality from their genetic code, scientists can predict how they will interact with other proteins, antibodies and drugs.
“When we launched last July it was recognised as a pretty big leap forward for biology,” Dr Demis Hassabis, CEO and Founder of DeepMind, said.
“It was also a great demonstration of how AI can be used to advance scientific discovery and it has provided structural biologists with this powerful new tool to look up the 3D structure of a protein almost as easily as doing a keyword Google search and, as we know, the 3D structure of proteins is vital for understanding their function. 
“You can think of [AlphaFold] as covering the entire protein universe.”
He added that more than half a million scientists have already used the ever-expanding directory for myriad projects.
'An entire universe in just one click'
Professor Ewan Birney, Deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), which helped develop AlphaFold with DeepMind, added it was “remarkable” that the entire protein universe is now available in just one or two clicks. 
“It will make many researchers around the world think about what experiments they could do,” he said. 
AlphaFold has been touted as one of the biggest scientific advances in recent years and has the potential to revolutionise various fields, including pharmacology, agronomy and vaccine manufacture. It is also being used to tackle the existential issues of plastic pollution and antibiotic resistance.
One major avenue which is being aided by AlphaFold’s technological insight is that of disease treatment.
Scientists at Duke University and the National University of Singapore published a paper in May based on results made possible by AlphaFold. 
They focused on a protein called phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) which they were able to identify as something which helps protect the brain but is targeted and destroyed by the immune system of Parkinson’s sufferers. 
Before now the structure of this protein was never known in detail and AlphaFold was able to accurately predict the structure from the DNA and amino acid arrangement of the protein.
This, the researchers said, was “in excellent agreement” with the more blurry picture of the protein made via experiments. 
By enabling researchers to get over their technological and laboratory hurdles, AlphaFold has elevated almost all fields of biology. It is a watershed moment for the life sciences and will reap rewards in scores of different fields in the years to come. 
‘AlphaFold was transformational’
Prof Matt Higgins, Professor of Molecular Parasitologyat the University of Oxford, is using AlphaFold to fight malaria by creating new vaccines against the mosquito-borne parasite. 
His protein of interest had always been “fuzzy”, despite years of lab work, he said. 
“The use of AlphaFold was really transformational, giving us a really sharp view of this maaria surface protein,” Prof Higgins said. 
This has now led to new vaccine candidates being produced, and they are now in testing, Prof Higgins said.
‘I’ve never seen anything like it’
“AlphaFold has sent ripples through the molecular biology community. In the past year alone, there have been over a thousand scientific articles on a broad range of research topics which use AlphaFold structures; I have never seen anything like it,” said Dr Sameer Velankar, Team Leader at EMBL-EBI’s Protein Data Bank in Europe.
“And this is just the impact of one million predictions; imagine the impact of having over 200 million protein structure predictions openly accessible in the AlphaFold Database.”

By enabling researchers to get over their technological and laboratory hurdles, AlphaFold has elevated almost all fields of biology. It is a watershed moment for the life sciences and will reap rewards in scores of different fields in the years to come. ‘AlphaFold was transformational’ Prof Matt Higgins, Professor of Molecular Parasitologyat the University of Oxford, is using AlphaFold to fight malaria by creating new vaccines against the mosquito-borne parasite. His protein of interest had always been “fuzzy”, despite years of lab work, he said. “The use of AlphaFold was really transformational, giving us a really sharp view of this maaria surface protein,” Prof Higgins said. This has now led to new vaccine candidates being produced, and they are now in testing, Prof Higgins said. ‘I’ve never seen anything like it’ “AlphaFold has sent ripples through the molecular biology community. In the past year alone, there have been over a thousand scientific articles on a broad range of research topics which use AlphaFold structures; I have never seen anything like it,” said Dr Sameer Velankar, Team Leader at EMBL-EBI’s Protein Data Bank in Europe. “And this is just the impact of one million predictions; imagine the impact of having over 200 million protein structure predictions openly accessible in the AlphaFold Database.” Related Topics Alphabet, DeepMind Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Malaria, Parkinson's disease, Health Twitter Icon Facebook Icon WhatsApp Icon Email Icon Comment speech bubble icon Comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

DeepMind, a company based in London and owned by Alphabet, the Silicon Valley tech giant that owns Google, first revealed its AlphaFold technology last year when it contained the 3D shape and structure of around 350,000 proteins. Now, the database has expanded to more than 200 million proteins, which is almost all the proteins known to science and covers animals, proteins, bacteria and everything in between. By accurately unpicking how proteins look in reality from their genetic code, scientists can predict how they will interact with other proteins, antibodies and drugs. “When we launched last July it was recognised as a pretty big leap forward for biology,” Dr Demis Hassabis, CEO and Founder of DeepMind, said. “It was also a great demonstration of how AI can be used to advance scientific discovery and it has provided structural biologists with this powerful new tool to look up the 3D structure of a protein almost as easily as doing a keyword Google search and, as we know, the 3D structure of proteins is vital for understanding their function. “You can think of [AlphaFold] as covering the entire protein universe.” He added that more than half a million scientists have already used the ever-expanding directory for myriad projects. 'An entire universe in just one click' Professor Ewan Birney, Deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), which helped develop AlphaFold with DeepMind, added it was “remarkable” that the entire protein universe is now available in just one or two clicks. “It will make many researchers around the world think about what experiments they could do,” he said. AlphaFold has been touted as one of the biggest scientific advances in recent years and has the potential to revolutionise various fields, including pharmacology, agronomy and vaccine manufacture. It is also being used to tackle the existential issues of plastic pollution and antibiotic resistance. One major avenue which is being aided by AlphaFold’s technological insight is that of disease treatment. Scientists at Duke University and the National University of Singapore published a paper in May based on results made possible by AlphaFold. They focused on a protein called phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) which they were able to identify as something which helps protect the brain but is targeted and destroyed by the immune system of Parkinson’s sufferers. Before now the structure of this protein was never known in detail and AlphaFold was able to accurately predict the structure from the DNA and amino acid arrangement of the protein. This, the researchers said, was “in excellent agreement” with the more blurry picture of the protein made via experiments. By enabling researchers to get over their technological and laboratory hurdles, AlphaFold has elevated almost all fields of biology. It is a watershed moment for the life sciences and will reap rewards in scores of different fields in the years to come. ‘AlphaFold was transformational’ Prof Matt Higgins, Professor of Molecular Parasitologyat the University of Oxford, is using AlphaFold to fight malaria by creating new vaccines against the mosquito-borne parasite.

Charity issues AI warning over online child sexual abuse By PA Media   Published:  19:06 EST, 14 February 2024   |  Updated:  19:06 EST, 14 February 2024                 e-mail                            


 
                   Most UK adults have fears around the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular in relation to its potential to harm children, but many are unaware about how it is already being used in sexual abuse, according to new research. The study, from child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, found that 66% of adults said they had concerns about the impact of the technology on children. This was despite the research uncovering that the majority (70%) were not even aware that AI was already being used to generate sexual abuse images of children, and 40% did not know that such content was illegal. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation said it was publishing its findings in an effort to boost awareness around the use of AI to exploit children. The foundation, which runs the anonymous and confidential helpline Stop It Now, said it wanted to remind people of the law and what constitutes online child sexual abuse in the UK. Donald Findlater, director of the helpline, said: “With AI and its capabilities rapidly evolving, it’s vital that people understand the dangers and how this technology is being exploited by online child sex offenders every day.          (PA)  “Our research shows there are serious knowledge gaps amongst the public regarding AI – specifically its ability to cause harm to children. “Unfortunately, the reality is that people are using this new, and unregulated, technology to create illegal sexual images of children, as well as so-called ‘nudified images’ of real children, including children who have been abused. “People must know that AI is not an emerging threat – it’s here, now. Stop It Now helpline advisers deal with hundreds of people every week seeking help to stop viewing of sexual images of under-18s. “These callers include people viewing AI-generated child sexual abuse material. We want the public to be absolutely clear that viewing sexual images of under-18s, whether AI-generated or not, is illegal and causes very serious harm to real children across the world. “To anyone that needs support to change their online behaviours, contact the Stop It Now helpline. We can offer free, confidential support before it’s too late.” The campaign to boost awareness has been backed by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which proactively tracks down and removes child sexual abuse imagery online. Dan Sexton, IWF chief technical officer, said: “There is a very real risk we could face a landslide of AI generated child sexual abuse which is completely indistinguishable from real images of children being raped and sexually tortured. “These new technologies are allowing offenders to mass produce imagery of children who have already suffered abuse in real life, and create imagery of those same children in new scenarios. “The potential impact for those trying to rid the internet of this material is profound – and the impact on children, who are made victims all over again every time this imagery is shared, is hard to comprehend. “This is a bleak new front in the war on child sexual abuse imagery, and one which could well get out of control if serious action is not taken now to get a grip on it.”

","Charity issues AI warning over online child sexual abuse | Daily Mail Online Home Showbiz Femail Royals Sports Health Wellness Science Politics Money U.K. Video Travel Puzzles Shopping Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Wednesday, Feb 14th 2024 7PM 38°F 10PM 35°F 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Charity issues AI warning over online child sexual abuse By PA Media Published: 19:06 EST, 14 February 2024 | Updated: 19:06 EST, 14 February 2024 e-mail Most UK adults have fears around the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular in relation to its potential to harm children, but many are unaware about how it is already being used in sexual abuse, according to new research. The study, from child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, found that 66% of adults said they had concerns about the impact of the technology on children. This was despite the research uncovering that the majority (70%) were not even aware that AI was already being used to generate sexual abuse images of children, and 40% did not know that such content was illegal. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation said it was publishing its findings in an effort to boost awareness around the use of AI to exploit children. The foundation, which runs the anonymous and confidential helpline Stop It Now, said it wanted to remind people of the law and what constitutes online child sexual abuse in the UK. Donald Findlater, director of the helpline, said: “With AI and its capabilities rapidly evolving, it’s vital that people understand the dangers and how this technology is being exploited by online child sex offenders every day. (PA) “Our research shows there are serious knowledge gaps amongst the public regarding AI – specifically its ability to cause harm to children. “Unfortunately, the reality is that people are using this new, and unregulated, technology to create illegal sexual images of children, as well as so-called ‘nudified images’ of real children, including children who have been abused. “People must know that AI is not an emerging threat – it’s here, now. Stop It Now helpline advisers deal with hundreds of people every week seeking help to stop viewing of sexual images of under-18s. “These callers include people viewing AI-generated child sexual abuse material. We want the public to be absolutely clear that viewing sexual images of under-18s, whether AI-generated or not, is illegal and causes very serious harm to real children across the world. “To anyone that needs support to change their online behaviours, contact the Stop It Now helpline. We can offer free, confidential support before it’s too late.” The campaign to boost awareness has been backed by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which proactively tracks down and removes child sexual abuse imagery online. Dan Sexton, IWF chief technical officer, said: “There is a very real risk we could face a landslide of AI generated child sexual abuse which is completely indistinguishable from real images of children being raped and sexually tortured. “These new technologies are allowing offenders to mass produce imagery of children who have already suffered abuse in real life, and create imagery of those same children in new scenarios. “The potential impact for those trying to rid the internet of this material is profound – and the impact on children, who are made victims all over again every time this imagery is shared, is hard to comprehend. “This is a bleak new front in the war on child sexual abuse imagery, and one which could well get out of control if serious action is not taken now to get a grip on it.” Share or comment on this article: Charity issues AI warning over online child sexual abuse e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Dan Sexton, IWF chief technical officer, said: “There is a very real risk we could face a landslide of AI generated child sexual abuse which is completely indistinguishable from real images of children being raped and sexually tortured. “These new technologies are allowing offenders to mass produce imagery of children who have already suffered abuse in real life, and create imagery of those same children in new scenarios. “The potential impact for those trying to rid the internet of this material is profound – and the impact on children, who are made victims all over again every time this imagery is shared, is hard to comprehend. “This is a bleak new front in the war on child sexual abuse imagery, and one which could well get out of control if serious action is not taken now to get a grip on it.” Share or comment on this article: Charity issues AI warning over online child sexual abuse e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The system combines Virtek's proven vision technology and laser projection systems with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to inspect prefabricated wooden panels in seconds. It effectively eliminates the cost and time associated with manual inspection, exposes defects before they leave the factory, and provides a useful digital record of all panels inspected.(PRNewsfoto/Virtek)(PRNewswire)The IRIS™ Ai Panel Inspection System employs multiple cameras to capture prefabricated panel assemblies, harnesses AI to identify anomalies, and relies on its state-of-the-art laser projection system to highlight the precise position of ""shiners"" as well as nail positioning issues that require attention.As the wall panel passes through the inspection booth, cameras capture the full structure, including the position of nails. The AI-driven software applies progressive learning algorithms to identify which nails are positioned correctly and which are not. Then, as the panel exits the inspection booth, the Virtek laser projection system projects laser markings precisely on areas that need attention.In addition, because the system is able to inspect components very quickly, it provides real-time alerts for issues in upstream processes, such as the nailing process, so operators can investigate and resolve them quickly.Dietmar Wennemer, President and CEO of Virtek, said, ""For nearly 40 years, Virtek's laser solutions have been instrumental in streamlining the construction of roof trusses, floor trusses, and wall panels. Today, by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, we transform a very labor-intensive, cumbersome, manual inspection procedure into a completely automated process with a system that is incredibly easy to use. And the great thing is, because this system is built on our proprietary Iris Ai inspection platform, we can easily adapt it to other applications, with limited retraining.""Darian Butt, Senior Director of Product Management, added, ""Inspection can be a bottleneck in the overall production process.

FOCUS-Italian watchdog's AI staff struggle spotlights global challenge By Reuters   Published:  02:01 EDT, 22 March 2024   |  Updated:  02:01 EDT, 22 March 2024                 e-mail                            


 
                   By Elvira Pollina and Martin Coulter MILAN/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Soon after Italian watchdog Garante took on ChatGPT with a temporary shutdown locally last year, it tried to strengthen its team by hiring four artificial intelligence (AI) experts. But Italy's data protection agency could not recruit the people it wanted, with a dozen candidates dropping out over issues including pay, highlighting a growing challenge facing regulators around the world. ""The search process went worse than our low expectations,"" Garante board member Guida Scorza told Reuters, adding: ""We will come up with something else, but so far we have lost"". Demand for AI experience and expertise has surged since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022, and regulators have found themselves vying for talent from the same shallow pool. But relatively low pay, long hiring processes and visa problems are thwarting their hiring ambitions, industry participants familiar with the situation told Reuters. Other public bodies in the European Union could soon face similar problems, just as the bloc rolls out some of the most sweeping and impactful AI regulation in the world. The EU has been recruiting for its newly opened AI Office, which will oversee enforcement of the AI Act, as well as the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT) which covers both the AI Act and the Digital Services Act. ""The biggest problem will be enforcement and getting people for this,"" said EU lawmaker Dragos Tudorache, who oversaw the drafting of the AI Act. Meanwhile, Britain continues to recruit for its own AI Safety Institute, launched in the wake of the summit it held for world leaders in October. Many of the public sector roles advertised at these organisations offer salaries at a fraction of industry standards and appear geared towards recent graduates, which some warn may deter the best talent. TALENT SURGE Around the world, governments have acknowledged the need for AI expertise to keep tabs on the rapidly-developing technology. The United States has demonstrated a willingness to pay more and be more flexible about its recruitment processes. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. Office for Personnel Management (OPM) has granted government agencies the power to quickly hire AI expertise, as part of an ongoing ""talent surge"" in government, expediting the usual recruitment process. In February, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a first-of-its-kind initiative to create a new ""AI Corps"", aiming to recruit 50 AI experts. A DHS job ad offers IT specialists, focused on AI, a salary of $143,000 per year, similar to the private sector. By contrast, EU agencies, including the AI Office and ECAT, have offered around 50,000 to 60,000 euros ($65,166). An EU spokesperson told Reuters that ECAT currently employed 35 experts, and planned to hire 100 more for the AI Office. ""Working with the Office presents a unique and thrilling opportunity for passionate professionals to contribute significantly to shaping trustworthy AI in Europe and beyond,"" they said. In Britain, the AI Safety Institute has offered stronger incentives for its most senior posts. Recently advertised roles - including chief information security officer and head of engineering - offered up to 135,000 pounds ($170,829). However, other roles offered much less. One overseeing the societal impacts of AI offered up to 47,000 pounds. Another British government role, at the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT), offered up to 76,000 pounds for a head of AI regulation strategy and implementation. Ian Hogarth, chair of the AI Safety Institute, told Reuters the organisation had successfully recruited experts from companies like Google DeepMind and OpenAI. ""While we do benchmark our salaries against those on offer in industry, the technical experts that are joining us from the top of their fields do so seeking more than a high salary,"" he said. ""They are joining to contribute to a critical mission to make sure these models are safe."" Last month, a report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which advises governments on policy matters, called on the UK government to relax normal recruitment rules, loosen pay restrictions and roll out new work visas for tech talent. ""Getting the depth of talent needed so that governments can not only ask the right questions, but also find solutions, will require a fundamental mindset shift in skills and culture,"" said the institute's Chief Policy Strategist Benedict Macon-Cooney. ($1 = 0.7903 pounds) ($1 = 0.9207 euros) (Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alexander Smith)

","FOCUS-Italian watchdog's AI staff struggle spotlights... | Daily Mail Online Home Showbiz Femail Royals Sports Health Wellness Science Politics Money U.K. Video Travel Puzzles Shopping Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Mar 22nd 2024 1AM 37°F 4AM 35°F 5-Day Forecast Advertisement FOCUS-Italian watchdog's AI staff struggle spotlights global challenge By Reuters Published: 02:01 EDT, 22 March 2024 | Updated: 02:01 EDT, 22 March 2024 e-mail By Elvira Pollina and Martin Coulter MILAN/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Soon after Italian watchdog Garante took on ChatGPT with a temporary shutdown locally last year, it tried to strengthen its team by hiring four artificial intelligence (AI) experts. But Italy's data protection agency could not recruit the people it wanted, with a dozen candidates dropping out over issues including pay, highlighting a growing challenge facing regulators around the world. ""The search process went worse than our low expectations,"" Garante board member Guida Scorza told Reuters, adding: ""We will come up with something else, but so far we have lost"". Demand for AI experience and expertise has surged since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022, and regulators have found themselves vying for talent from the same shallow pool. But relatively low pay, long hiring processes and visa problems are thwarting their hiring ambitions, industry participants familiar with the situation told Reuters. Other public bodies in the European Union could soon face similar problems, just as the bloc rolls out some of the most sweeping and impactful AI regulation in the world. The EU has been recruiting for its newly opened AI Office, which will oversee enforcement of the AI Act, as well as the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT) which covers both the AI Act and the Digital Services Act. ""The biggest problem will be enforcement and getting people for this,"" said EU lawmaker Dragos Tudorache, who oversaw the drafting of the AI Act. Meanwhile, Britain continues to recruit for its own AI Safety Institute, launched in the wake of the summit it held for world leaders in October. Many of the public sector roles advertised at these organisations offer salaries at a fraction of industry standards and appear geared towards recent graduates, which some warn may deter the best talent. TALENT SURGE Around the world, governments have acknowledged the need for AI expertise to keep tabs on the rapidly-developing technology. The United States has demonstrated a willingness to pay more and be more flexible about its recruitment processes. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. Office for Personnel Management (OPM) has granted government agencies the power to quickly hire AI expertise, as part of an ongoing ""talent surge"" in government, expediting the usual recruitment process. In February, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a first-of-its-kind initiative to create a new ""AI Corps"", aiming to recruit 50 AI experts. A DHS job ad offers IT specialists, focused on AI, a salary of $143,000 per year, similar to the private sector. By contrast, EU agencies, including the AI Office and ECAT, have offered around 50,000 to 60,000 euros ($65,166). An EU spokesperson told Reuters that ECAT currently employed 35 experts, and planned to hire 100 more for the AI Office. ""Working with the Office presents a unique and thrilling opportunity for passionate professionals to contribute significantly to shaping trustworthy AI in Europe and beyond,"" they said. In Britain, the AI Safety Institute has offered stronger incentives for its most senior posts. Recently advertised roles - including chief information security officer and head of engineering - offered up to 135,000 pounds ($170,829). However, other roles offered much less. One overseeing the societal impacts of AI offered up to 47,000 pounds. Another British government role, at the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT), offered up to 76,000 pounds for a head of AI regulation strategy and implementation. Ian Hogarth, chair of the AI Safety Institute, told Reuters the organisation had successfully recruited experts from companies like Google DeepMind and OpenAI. ""While we do benchmark our salaries against those on offer in industry, the technical experts that are joining us from the top of their fields do so seeking more than a high salary,"" he said. ""They are joining to contribute to a critical mission to make sure these models are safe."" Last month, a report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which advises governments on policy matters, called on the UK government to relax normal recruitment rules, loosen pay restrictions and roll out new work visas for tech talent. ""Getting the depth of talent needed so that governments can not only ask the right questions, but also find solutions, will require a fundamental mindset shift in skills and culture,"" said the institute's Chief Policy Strategist Benedict Macon-Cooney.

But Italy's data protection agency could not recruit the people it wanted, with a dozen candidates dropping out over issues including pay, highlighting a growing challenge facing regulators around the world. ""The search process went worse than our low expectations,"" Garante board member Guida Scorza told Reuters, adding: ""We will come up with something else, but so far we have lost"". Demand for AI experience and expertise has surged since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022, and regulators have found themselves vying for talent from the same shallow pool. But relatively low pay, long hiring processes and visa problems are thwarting their hiring ambitions, industry participants familiar with the situation told Reuters. Other public bodies in the European Union could soon face similar problems, just as the bloc rolls out some of the most sweeping and impactful AI regulation in the world. The EU has been recruiting for its newly opened AI Office, which will oversee enforcement of the AI Act, as well as the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT) which covers both the AI Act and the Digital Services Act. ""The biggest problem will be enforcement and getting people for this,"" said EU lawmaker Dragos Tudorache, who oversaw the drafting of the AI Act. Meanwhile, Britain continues to recruit for its own AI Safety Institute, launched in the wake of the summit it held for world leaders in October. Many of the public sector roles advertised at these organisations offer salaries at a fraction of industry standards and appear geared towards recent graduates, which some warn may deter the best talent. TALENT SURGE Around the world, governments have acknowledged the need for AI expertise to keep tabs on the rapidly-developing technology. The United States has demonstrated a willingness to pay more and be more flexible about its recruitment processes. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. Office for Personnel Management (OPM) has granted government agencies the power to quickly hire AI expertise, as part of an ongoing ""talent surge"" in government, expediting the usual recruitment process. In February, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a first-of-its-kind initiative to create a new ""AI Corps"", aiming to recruit 50 AI experts. A DHS job ad offers IT specialists, focused on AI, a salary of $143,000 per year, similar to the private sector. By contrast, EU agencies, including the AI Office and ECAT, have offered around 50,000 to 60,000 euros ($65,166). An EU spokesperson told Reuters that ECAT currently employed 35 experts, and planned to hire 100 more for the AI Office. ""Working with the Office presents a unique and thrilling opportunity for passionate professionals to contribute significantly to shaping trustworthy AI in Europe and beyond,"" they said. In Britain, the AI Safety Institute has offered stronger incentives for its most senior posts. Recently advertised roles - including chief information security officer and head of engineering - offered up to 135,000 pounds ($170,829). However, other roles offered much less. One overseeing the societal impacts of AI offered up to 47,000 pounds. Another British government role, at the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT), offered up to 76,000 pounds for a head of AI regulation strategy and implementation. Ian Hogarth, chair of the AI Safety Institute, told Reuters the organisation had successfully recruited experts from companies like Google DeepMind and OpenAI. ""While we do benchmark our salaries against those on offer in industry, the technical experts that are joining us from the top of their fields do so seeking more than a high salary,"" he said. ""They are joining to contribute to a critical mission to make sure these models are safe."" Last month, a report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which advises governments on policy matters, called on the UK government to relax normal recruitment rules, loosen pay restrictions and roll out new work visas for tech talent. ""Getting the depth of talent needed so that governments can not only ask the right questions, but also find solutions, will require a fundamental mindset shift in skills and culture,"" said the institute's Chief Policy Strategist Benedict Macon-Cooney.

The most popular Met Gala look will make you question everything you see online

A closer look gives away the inconsistencies (Picture: Twitter/ Metro.co.uk)One of the most popular images to emerge from this week’s Met Gala Monday were those of Selena Gomez on the red carpet — except she wasn’t actually there.
The image was a digitally altered one of Lily James posing in a Versace gown from last year’s Met Gala, superimposed with Gomez’s face. 
The fake picture received more likes than anyone’s real Met Gala look on Twitter, according to celebrity news fan account PopFaction.
Whoever altered the picture even changed the colour of the dress from lavender to blue. So even if you had seen the original look, it would have been hard to tell the difference at first glance. Maybe she was just wearing a different version of the Versace dress?
Sure, a closer look gives away the inconsistencies: the photographers in the background don’t really fit, the colour of this year’s Met Gala carpet was all wrong, the pictures were cropped funny, and the more you looked at it, you could just tell.
Except, who has the time for a closer look when you’re on a mile-a-minute doomscroll?

Once we see something that remotely falls within the Venn diagram of our interests and followers’ reaction value, we hit the share button. Images like these and reckless sharing make for a dangerous pairing.
Many people were creeped out by how real the images looked and pointed to AI for the deception.
But even in the age of AI, it seems we all fell for a good ol’ Photoshop gag. This was not the work of generative AI which creates images based on prompts.
To be fair Photoshop has gotten a lot smarter and AI does have something to do with it.
Last year, Adobe introduced improvements to its AI capabilities, so higher-quality object selections could be made. With that, lifelike editing could be possible with much less time and skill.
Zendaya was another celebrity who was Photoshopped into this year’s Met Gala, her face being edited onto Rita Ora’s pictures from the same night.
This happened seemingly quickly as the original images of Ora were taken only hours before the fake ones were shared. The ease and speed with which this can be done is as unsettling as it is impressive.
As these technologies get smarter, the incident is a reminder that trusting things on the internet will only get harder.

Remember the AI-generated picture of the Pope in a puffer jacket and images of Donald Trump being arrested by the police?
The reason that all these posts went viral can be blamed on knee-jerk reactions and people hitting the share button without checking if it was real. 
The internet was always a breeding ground for misinformation but AI continues to blur the line between reality and fiction.
Many companies are embracing AI as a tool that can amplify what humans can do. That also means amplifying the wrongs of the humans behind the prompts. 
There are several ethical cases to be made about the issue of deepfake. For example, celebrities or influencers can pass themselves off as being, doing, or wearing somewhere when they weren’t. This could have devastating effects on the authenticity of influencer marketing that brands and consumers have come to rely on.
Still, the burden of falling for a very well-made deepfake cannot fall on the viewer alone. Platforms have to do their part in placing checks on the creation and indiscriminate sharing of these images.
In the case of the fake images of Gomez, Elon Musk might have finally made a single positive contribution to Twitter.
The Community Notes feature allowed people to collaboratively add context to the original tweet with the fake images of Gomez, flagging them with the note, ‘Selena Gomez did not attend the 2023 Met Gala and has not attended the Met Gala since 2018. These are altered images of Lily James at the 2022 Met Gala.’
It also provided context by adding links to articles about James’ original dress and why Gomez wouldn’t be attending this year’s Met Gala.

When it comes to AI deepfakes we might have to fight fire with fire. Just like AI can be used to perform insanely great edits on pictures, tools that can identify if images have been Photoshopped also exist.
Recently, Within Health, a digital service for people suffering with eating disorders, used an AI-powered tool known as a FAL Detector on magazine photos of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie to reveal exactly how they’ve been altered.
This is only the beginning of technology-enabled fake images, audio and video that we fall for. Our tendency to trust things we see on the internet is set to be tested. We can only hope that the trust issues stemming from this aren’t too severe.

The company however said it had fixed the issue, which triggered unusually high error rates across its software and AI platform.OpenAI, which held its first-ever developer conference on Monday, has introduced a preview version of GPT-4 Turbo, a more powerful and speedier version of its most recent large language model, the technology that underpins ChatGPT.The chatbot was released to the public a year ago this month, kicking off a global frenzy around all things AI. Roughly 100 million people now use ChatGPT each week, the company said at the conference, and more than 90% of Fortune 500 businesses are building tools on OpenAI’s platform. But the ChatGPT maker is also confronting rival products from well-funded AI startups, tech giants and, most recently, Elon Musk, an early OpenAI backer.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.Get live Stock market updates, Business news, Today’s latest news, Trending stories, and Videos on BQ Prime.

I Asked AI To Create The Most Beautiful Watch In The World… This Is What It Gave Me

Not bad for a first attempt...

Artificial Intelligence can do many things. It can help to read large body of text in seconds, book hair appointments and even produce high quality scenes from James Bond films that never were. But can it do somehting that feels innately human? By creating the most beautiful watch in the world. It’s 2024 and the AI Revolution is in full swing. But whilst I’m quietly subscribing to any updates from OpenAI and Google’s mind-blowing chatbots to see if I’ll still have a job in 5-10 years, it’s also presenting a fun opportunity to test out the program’s many possibilities, such as AI-generated imagery. Eager to test the capabilities of these programs, I decided to challenge the AI to create the most beautiful watch in the world, eagerly anticipating what enviable creations it could produce from my simple text prompts.RELATED: New Japanese AI Sparks Fear As It Reads People’s MindsImage: DMARGESo the experiment was simple: Ask the chatbot to produce the most beautiful watch in the world. At first, the imagery was quite basic to look at. The watches themselves weren’t inherently beautiful; they were flawed and inconsistent. 

Notably all four iterations had stainless steel cases with a rounded dial – two appeared to be chronographs with a stopwatch feature on the side of the case. One featured a classic chronograph style, complete with a polished blue dial and four subdials sitting at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock, whilst the other opted for a minimalist design. Something that I found interesting was that all four creations boasted a tachymeter that ran along the length of the bezel of the watches – a key feature of the chronograph that’s used to measure and determine speed, often in motoracing or other sports. Similarly, they all featured a brown leather strap… even if one was reversed. I started to get the hang of my prompts, so I thought it would be a worthwhile exercise to feed the chatbot some more information and direction to inform its creative choices. So I wrote:“Create the most beautiful watch in the world. Take inspiration from Swiss haute horology and premium watch brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet. The watches must justify the price tag.”Image: DMARGEIt’s at this point that our new chatbot artist began to grease the joints and flex its proverbial muscles, experimenting with premium watchmaking materials and introducing more impressive features to each of the unique iterations. It was worth pointing out that we were treated to more than just one watch design in each image, likely owing to the increase in direction and prompts that I was delivering. But it was good to see the chatbot was thinking about its creative choices.  

Straight away, the chatbot introduced more premium materials to the watches – rose gold bezels and 18-carat (I’m assuming) bracelet reminiscent of a Rolex Oyster bracelet. Elsewhere, open-worked dials reveals the Maison’s more revered movements and looked like a sloppy remake of one of our favourite Watches & Wonders 2024 releases: Jaeger LeCoultre’s Duometre.While the initial attempts were basic and flawed, with time and more precise prompts, it was surprising to see that the AI began to incorporate luxurious materials and intricate details reminiscent of high-end Swiss horology. But at the end of the day, the AI couldn’t create anything new; they were reworks of old designs, a scrapbook of a Rolex Pinterest board. I think it’s safe to say, Swiss manufactures R&D departments can sleep easy tonight.

UK 'losing race against time' to regulate AI in the workplace, unions warnThe TUC said employment law is failing to keep pace with the rapid speed of technological change, leaving many workers vulnerable to exploitation and discriminationUnions say the UK is losing a race against time to regulate ai in the workplace (Image: No credit)ByLawrence MathesonAlan Jones, PA Industrial Correspondent10:59, 18 Apr 2024The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has issued a warning that the UK is falling behind in the ""race against time"" to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace.  The TUC argues that employment law is not keeping up with the rapid pace of technological advancements, leaving workers at risk of exploitation and discrimination. The union body has released a ""ready-to-go"" legal blueprint for AI regulation in the workplace, developed in collaboration with legal experts.  This blueprint outlines new legal rights and protections, including a legal obligation for employers to consult trade unions on the use of high-risk and intrusive AI in the workplace, as well as protections against unfair dismissal by AI. The TUC is urging all political parties to support this regulation, describing it as an ""urgent national priority"".  The organisation highlighted that AI is already making high-stakes decisions about workers' lives, such as managing, hiring, and firing staff, and analysing facial expressions, tone of voice, and accents to assess job candidates' suitability. The TUC warned that the UK risks becoming an international outlier in terms of AI regulation, pointing out that other countries like the US, China, Canada, and EU nations are already implementing new laws governing AI usage. TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell has sounded the alarm on the UK's lagging behind in AI workplace regulation, stating: ""UK employment law is simply failing to keep pace with the rapid speed of technological change. We are losing the race to regulate AI in the workplace."" ""AI is already making life-changing calls in the workplace, including how people are hired, performance managed and fired. We urgently need to put new guardrails in place to protect workers from exploitation and discrimination. This should be a national priority. Other countries are regulating workplace AI so that staff and employers know where they stand. The UK can't afford to drag its feet and become an international outlier.""  A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: ""Harnessing the power of AI should not be at the expense of employment rights or protections and that's why the UK is leading the world on the safe and responsible adoption of AI, having held the first ever AI Summit at Bletchley Park last year. We've already taken steps to upskill workers for jobs both in and with AI through £290million worth of investment since 2018 and are working with businesses and regulators on the safe and responsible adoption of AI in the workplace.  Our response to the AI Regulation White Paper consultation backs our expert regulators to help us navigate the challenges of this technology, with a £10 million support package to deliver the skills, expertise, and institutions we need to ensure any legislation when introduced will be at its most effective.""Most Read     Don't Miss  FollowMirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ONEuropean UnionTrades Union CongressGet our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterSign upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

This blueprint outlines new legal rights and protections, including a legal obligation for employers to consult trade unions on the use of high-risk and intrusive AI in the workplace, as well as protections against unfair dismissal by AI. The TUC is urging all political parties to support this regulation, describing it as an ""urgent national priority"". The organisation highlighted that AI is already making high-stakes decisions about workers' lives, such as managing, hiring, and firing staff, and analysing facial expressions, tone of voice, and accents to assess job candidates' suitability. The TUC warned that the UK risks becoming an international outlier in terms of AI regulation, pointing out that other countries like the US, China, Canada, and EU nations are already implementing new laws governing AI usage. TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell has sounded the alarm on the UK's lagging behind in AI workplace regulation, stating: ""UK employment law is simply failing to keep pace with the rapid speed of technological change. We are losing the race to regulate AI in the workplace."" ""AI is already making life-changing calls in the workplace, including how people are hired, performance managed and fired. We urgently need to put new guardrails in place to protect workers from exploitation and discrimination. This should be a national priority. Other countries are regulating workplace AI so that staff and employers know where they stand. The UK can't afford to drag its feet and become an international outlier."" A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: ""Harnessing the power of AI should not be at the expense of employment rights or protections and that's why the UK is leading the world on the safe and responsible adoption of AI, having held the first ever AI Summit at Bletchley Park last year. We've already taken steps to upskill workers for jobs both in and with AI through £290million worth of investment since 2018 and are working with businesses and regulators on the safe and responsible adoption of AI in the workplace. Our response to the AI Regulation White Paper consultation backs our expert regulators to help us navigate the challenges of this technology, with a £10 million support package to deliver the skills, expertise, and institutions we need to ensure any legislation when introduced will be at its most effective.""Most Read Don't Miss FollowMirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ONEuropean UnionTrades Union CongressGet our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterSign upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

 Nigeria to equip 70% of youths with AI skills to reduce unemployment 
 Nigeria to equip 70% of youths with AI skills to reduce unemployment

         Nigeria wants to equip 70 percent of its young workforce (aged 16 – 35 years) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) related skills and knowledge to reduce unemployment by five percentage points.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s unemployment rate was 5 percent in the third quarter of 2023, with the formal sector accounting for only 7.7 percent of employment opportunities. The draft National AI Strategy released on Friday revealed that the global demand for AI talents and skills is growing, and a highly skilled workforce is a critical long-term need of any well-functioning AI ecosystem.
The strategy document was drafted by Nigerian AI professionals and stakeholders under the supervision of the Ministry of Communication, Innovation and Digital Economy. It aims to leverage the country’s strengths and address its challenges, ensuring Nigeria isn’t left behind in the AI revolution.   
AI is poised to add $2.9 trillion to Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030, and the Nigerian AI market is projected to hit $434.4 million by 2026.
Equipping citizens with AI skills is a strategy already adopted by frontrunner nations, regions, and companies to attract, develop, and train talent to build and utilise AI technologies. The draft document emphasises that building an AI-ready workforce involves educating the future workforce at multiple levels, training the current workforce, attracting and retaining talent in AI, and drawing international talent to Nigeria.       
“Nigeria shall also emphasise technical skills and talent to drive AI adoption and initiatives, as well as change management, interaction design, legal and business models, communication, innovation management, and many more context-dependent skills,” the document read.
The drafters of the AI strategy expect Nigeria to actively contribute to the local and global workforce, job creation, and entrepreneurial endeavours in AI-driven industries. They noted that the country’s youthful population is a significant asset for promoting economic development, particularly in AI.
“This demographic trend underscores the critical role that Nigeria’s youth will play in the global economy, especially in providing a digitally enabled workforce for the global AI ecosystem requirements. Furthermore, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (46) forecasts that by 2030, 28 million jobs in Nigeria will demand digital skills, highlighting a market valued at $130 billion,” they added.

However, the strategy document acknowledges that Nigeria faces significant challenges in realising the full potential of its youth demographic due to high levels of poverty, unemployment, and insecurity.
Olumide Balogun, Director of Google West Africa, recently highlighted how AI can be leveraged to address some of these challenges.   
He said, “When people think about AI, they always think about robotics and very geeky and technical things. But if you think about what we are already doing with AI, things like flood forecasting in the North, where forecasts on flooding can get people out of harm’s way and give the government notice. Things like prenatal care, disease control, and food security are very close to what we need to do now.”
The shortage of skilled AI professionals poses a major challenge to Nigeria’s ambition of becoming a leader in AI development in Africa. Only 3 percent of IT professionals in Nigeria specialize in AI and robotics. The drafters of the strategy noted that the country’s educational infrastructure is not yet robust enough to support widespread AI education, with many institutions lacking the resources, technology, and trained educators needed to teach AI-related courses effectively.
GSMA, the umbrella body for telcos, recently revealed that most Nigerian universities are facing challenges in hiring professors with expertise in AI.
“In Kenya and Nigeria, the scarcity of professors with robust AI expertise and qualifications appears to be a significant challenge. Academic institutions typically lack the financial resources to recruit them, impacting the quality of courses offered,” it said.
The AI strategy also addresses the importance of responsible data collection for AI training, gaps in infrastructure, and the need for improved internet access and bandwidth to foster innovation in the country.

GSMA, the umbrella body for telcos, recently revealed that most Nigerian universities are facing challenges in hiring professors with expertise in AI. “In Kenya and Nigeria, the scarcity of professors with robust AI expertise and qualifications appears to be a significant challenge. Academic institutions typically lack the financial resources to recruit them, impacting the quality of courses offered,” it said. The AI strategy also addresses the importance of responsible data collection for AI training, gaps in infrastructure, and the need for improved internet access and bandwidth to foster innovation in the country.

Türkiye develops AI system to curb repeat offenses
ISTANBUL

Turkish authorities have developed an artificial intelligence-based risk analysis system aimed at assessing the risk levels of repeat offenders, specifically designed to predict whether domestic violence incidents may escalate into homicide.
This new system has its roots in an old method that came into effect in 2011, Professor Dr. Coşkun Taştan, a faculty member from the Police Academy, explained during his presentation to a parliamentary commission for violence against women.
This approach involved gathering information on the suspect as soon as a victim lodged a complaint, aiming to offer a swift procedure, but it proved insufficient in many cases.
""It was our responsibility to make this method better. We, therefore, crafted a system that enables quick, accurate and instantaneous decision-making by fortifying it with artificial intelligence,” Taştan explained.
This new application achieves this by conducting a risk analysis after key details are input into the system when a victim files a complaint. Within minutes, the AI-based system analyzes the backgrounds of both the suspect and the victim, generating a risk score.
“In other words, it warns us that ‘this could turn into murder,’ even before the crime has occurred,” Taştan noted.
Thus, if a case is classified as high risk, authorities can immediately take stricter protective measures and ensure a more swift, transparent and secure process.
The model boasts a 75 percent accuracy rate, significantly outperforming the U.K.'s HART system, another AI-based tool that assesses a suspect’s risk of reoffending (low, moderate, or high), which operates at 63.8 percent. This increased accuracy is expected to enhance law enforcement’s ability to prevent violent crimes before they occur.
Following a final test, the new system will be implemented in about 1,200 domestic violence bureaus throughout Türkiye this year, Taştan pointed out.
Beyond domestic violence cases, the system will also be utilized for general crime risk analysis.
A key issue in the justice system has been the conflict between law enforcement records and judicial decisions. Many offenders have multiple police records but remain free due to the absence of formal convictions in their judicial records. This was highlighted by the case of a 19-year-old suspect with 26 prior offenses, who was able to move freely before fatally shooting a police officer, sparking public outrage.
In an effort to address this issue, the AI model will generate risk assessment reports for courts, indicating whether an individual should be classified as a high-risk offender, helping judges make more informed decisions.

NetApp Fights Ransomware in Real-Time with Built-In Artificial Intelligence on Enterprise Storage and Enhanced Cyber-Resiliency Solutions

By CRN Team -   March 6, 2024 0

NetApp the intelligent data infrastructure company, today announced cyber-resiliency capabilities that will equip customers to better protect and recover their data in the face of ransomware threats. NetApp is one of the first to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) directly into enterprise primary storage to fight ransomware in real-time. The NetApp cyber-resiliency capabilities protect both primary and secondary data for organisations whether it is stored on-premises or in the cloud.
Cybercriminals are increasingly aiming ransomware attacks at critical infrastructure and supply chains where operational disruptions can cost millions of dollars, according to Forrester. As a result, 87 percent of C-suite and board-level executives ranked ransomware as a high, or the top, priority for their organisation, according to the NetApp 2023 Data Complexity report. When cybercriminals breach perimeters, networks, and identities storage becomes the last line of defence for organisations’ most critical data. With the threat of ransomware looming, organisations need solutions that not only protect their data but also quickly recover lost data and return to normal operations. NetApp is updating its cyber-resiliency solutions and leveraging the power of AI to give customers confidence that their data will be safe and accessible when they need it.
“NetApp is taking an aggressive and proactive approach to protecting our customers’ data against cyber threats using artificial intelligence. We are the first storage vendor to explicitly and financially guarantee our data storage offerings against ransomware,” said Mignona Cote, CSO at NetApp. “Today, we are furthering that leadership with updates that make defending data comprehensive, continuous, and simple for our customers.”
NetApp is focused on designing data storage and management systems that maximise data protection and security while meeting data governance and compliance standards, with new updates that include:

ONTAP Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) will spearhead the next generation of real-time enterprise storage ransomware protection, giving increased accuracy and performance required to detect and mitigate new, more sophisticated cyber threats. NetApp pioneered autonomous real-time detection of ransomware directly in primary enterprise storage three years ago. Now, NetApp will be leading the charge to use adaptive AI/ML models built directly into enterprise primary storage to look at file-level signals in real-time to detect even the newest ransomware attacks with planned 99%+ precision and recall. NetApp will be offering the first technology preview of ARP/AI within the next quarter.
NetApp BlueXP Ransomware Protection, now in public preview, provides a single control plane to intelligently coordinate and execute an end-to-end, workload-centric ransomware defence. Customers can now identify and protect critical workload data with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and respond to a potential attack, and recover workloads within minutes, safeguarding their valuable data and minimising costly disruption.
Application-Aware Ransomware Protection via NetApp SnapCenter 5.0 offers immutable ransomware protection for applications. SnapCenter will now apply NetApp’s leading ransomware protection technologies, previously used with unstructured data, to application-consistent backup. SnapCenter 5.0 includes support for key ONTAP features like tamperproof Snapshot copy locking, SnapLock protected volumes, and SnapMirror Business Continuity to enable more robust data protection for applications and virtual machines. SnapCenter 5.0 supports protection of applications on-premises with NetApp AFF, ASA, and FAS, as well as in the cloud.
NetApp BlueXP Disaster Recovery, now generally available, offers seamless integration with VMware infrastructure and provides storage options for both on-premises and major public cloud environments. This comprehensive solution eliminates the need for separate standby disaster recovery (DR) infrastructure, reducing costs. With NetApp BlueXP disaster recovery, failover and failback processes are simplified, allowing smooth transitions from on-premises VMware infrastructure to the public cloud or to an on-premises data centre.
NetApp Keystone Ransomware Recovery Guarantee extends NetApp’s current Ransomware Recovery Guarantee to our leading storage-as-a-service offering, NetApp Keystone. With this guarantee, NetApp will warrant snapshot data recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. If snapshot data copies can’t be recovered through NetApp, we will offer compensation.

“In a dynamic and distributed IT environment, organisations in India need to look beyond the traditional perimeter to strengthen their cyber resilience and disaster recovery capabilities,” said Puneet Gupta, Vice President and Managing Director, NetApp India/SAARC. “NetApp’s approach to cyber resilience is data-centric and embeds AI-driven protection directly into the storage infrastructure. It provides defence at its most critical point – where the data resides, in owned data centres or anywhere in the cloud.”
“Today’s cybersecurity teams face the monumental task of protecting their companies’ data from ever-evolving threats, especially ransomware,” said Archana Venkatraman, Research Director, Cloud Data Management, IDC. “NetApp’s approach of delivering a secure, unified storage infrastructure makes storage foundational for ransomware protection and reduces the burden on cybersecurity teams. Companies looking to fortify their cyber resiliency and shifting protection left will increasingly look to vendors that take a secure-by-design approach and develop unified storage and data services.”
“Using NetApp in our Advanced Technology Centre, we significantly simplified our replication process for VMware virtual machines and their underlying datastores to meet or exceed recovery benchmarks,” said Derek Elbert, Solutions Architect at WWT. “With NetApp’s solutions, we successfully established the recovery policies for cloud volumes workloads or virtual machines with no existing DR strategy, managing everything through NetApp BlueXP. This transforms how we operate disaster recovery for VMware.”
“To store sensitive genomics and health data, we have to use the right technology with layers of security built in,” said Mark Cowley, Deputy Director at Children’s Cancer Institute. “With NetApp, we can be very confident that we are sharing the right data only to authorised researchers. The last line of defence is your weakest web-based system, so we’ve implemented role-based access and added resilience to all of our tools.”
The latest cyber resiliency updates from NetApp empower organisations to proactively address cybersecurity threats in complex hybrid and multi cloud environments, leveraging AI to identify threats and prevent disruptions to their operations.

Jacob Willeford11:44 ET, Aug 21 2022Updated: 11:46 ET, Aug 21 2022THIS expert explains that quantum computing could be more dangerous to humanity than artificial intelligence, and it needs to be controlled better before it's too late.
According to technology expert and Stanford University scholar Mauritz Kop, AI isn't nearly at the level that many tech moguls have made it seem in recent years, per Foreign Policy.

""Today’s artificial intelligence is as self-aware as a paper clip. Despite the hype—such as a Google engineer’s bizarre claim that his company’s AI system had “come to life” and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweet predicting that computers will have human intelligence by 2029—the technology still fails at simple everyday tasks,"" Kop explains.
There has been consistent hysteria that has surrounded AI for years and the predictions from many like Musk who feel it could be humanity's biggest threat as we near 2030.
This is mainly because governments around the world haven't officially regulated AI and the attempts to see if computers can indeed become sentient and achieve human intelligence.
Dangers of the most basic AI that is currently available, however, have been apparent through its government usage over the years, per Kop.

""Precisely because today’s AI is little more than a brute, unintelligent system for automating decisions using algorithms and other technologies that crunch superhuman amounts of data, its widespread use by governments and companies to surveil public spaces, monitor social media, create deepfakes, and unleash autonomous lethal weapons has become dangerous to humanity,"" he notes.
The lack of regulation makes it even worse, with massive corporations like Meta and Google being left responsible to determine anything and everything to do with AI.
Although the biggest threat to us doesn't come from AI, but rather what's called quantum computing, Kop explains.
What is quantum computing, though?

Digital computing operates on a unit system of 1s and 0s, but quantum computing uses a unit called a qubit.
""A qubit can hold values of 1 and 0 simultaneously by incorporating a counterintuitive property in quantum physics called superposition,"" says Kop.
""Thus, two qubits could represent the sequences 1-0, 1-1, 0-1, and 0-0, all in parallel and all at the same instant. That allows a vast increase in computing power, which grows exponentially with each additional qubit.""
Essentially, quantum computers can process multiple sequences from normal digital operating systems in a single instant.
Although quantum computing remains in a mostly experimental stage from what we know, merging it into society could change our way of life drastically.
""With their power to quickly crunch immense amounts of data that would overwhelm any of today’s systems, quantum computers could potentially enable better weather forecasting, financial analysis, logistics planning, space research, and drug discovery,"" the experts predict.
Those are certainly all the positive benefits that could come from it, but the fear resides in how quickly a quantum computer could crack even the toughest encryptions.
""But quantum computers—taking advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty—may potentially be able to try out combinations so rapidly that they could crack encryptions by brute force almost instantaneously,"" Kop fears.
""Some actors will very likely use them for nefarious purposes, compromising bank records, private communications, and passwords on every digital computer in the world.""
We shouldn't have to fear too much just yet, as again, quantum computing still resides in its very early stages.
However, not getting ahead of it by placing regulations on how it's used could put society in a dangerous place according to Kop.
Not to mention that neglecting it could put quantum computing in a place to be combined with AI.
""Experiments are also working to combine quantum computing with AI to transcend traditional computers’ limits,"" he explains.
""Combined with quantum computing, AI could, in theory, lead to even more revolutionary outcomes than the AI sentience that critics have been warning about.""
Either way, Kop feels that the biggest dangers in quantum computing by itself occur in its autonomous decision-making.
""The dangers lie in the machine’s ability to make decisions autonomously, with flaws in the computer code resulting in unanticipated, often detrimental, outcomes,"" he says.
Small steps are already trying to be taken to get ahead of these dangers by the quantum computing community according to Kop.
""In 2021, the quantum community issued a call for action to urgently address these concerns. In addition, critical public and private intellectual property on quantum-enabling technologies must be protected from theft and abuse by the United States’ adversaries,"" he explains.
Although, some of the most important issues that governments could face when quantum computing becomes more integrated have to do with ethics.
Kop hopes that we can learn from the ethical mistakes of AI when thinking of quantum computing.
He explains that ""democratic nations need to institute controls that both correspond to the power of the technology as well as respect democratic values, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.""

China is already in the lead of the quantum computing community according to Kop, which he feels could create dominance over the United States and other countries in the western part of the world.
Overall, the concern over what quantum computing can do should trump the wonders of AI sentience, no matter which country it originates from.

Quietly released to the app's more than a billion users, Bold Glamour convincingly blends a user's real face with an AI-generated ideal of a supermodel, drawing both laughs and alarm.Millions of posts on TikTok capture the shock at Bold Glamour's superpowers, with users marveling at their plumped up lips, well-chiseled chin and fluffy eyebrows worthy of a fashionista.""It's the new onslaught of the 'beauty myth',"" said Kim Johnson, associate professor of nursing at Middle Georgia State University in the United States.Effects like Bold Glamour ""lead to unhealthy behaviors such as excessive dieting, comparison, and low self-esteem,"" Johnson said.Filters and effects have been a stalwart of TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat for years, but the latest generation of features like Bold Glamour are supercharged.""It is not subtle. It is instantaneous. It is powerful,"" said Gwendolyn Seidman, professor of psychology at Albright College, in Psychology Today.Those yearning for social approval, like under-pressure teens, ""won't like what they see when they turn the filter off, and that's the problem,"" she added.'So cool'But beyond Bold Glamour's troubling aesthetic, observers are scratching their heads about the technology itself and wondering if the app is an unsung advance in artificial intelligence.Earlier filters overlayed an effect -- like joke lenses on Snapchat -- over an onscreen face and were easily discernible with a sudden movement or by waving a hand in front of the image.""What's so cool about this is that you can ... take your hand and put it in front of your face and it (continues to look) pretty darn real,"" mixed reality artist Luke Hurd explained on TikTok.And while the technology has been available on powerful computers, real-time video filters are now on smartphones, ready for all.""This is AI for the masses to alter one's appearance and that's what's catching so many people's attention,"" said Andrew Selepak, a social media professor at the University of Florida.Contacted by AFP, TikTok declined to discuss the technology behind the app, leaving an air of mystery on how Bold Glamour actually works.The company did insist that ""being true to yourself is celebrated and encouraged"" on the site and that effects help empower ""self-expression and creativity.""""We continue to work with expert partners and our community, to help keep TikTok a positive, supportive space for everyone,"" TikTok said in a statement.According to experts, Bold Glamour is using generative AI, following the same idea behind ChatGPT or Dall-E, apps that can churn out poems or art and designs on demand almost instantaneously.Petr Somol, the AI research director at Gen, a tech security firm, said these type of filters have existed for a couple of years, but TikTok's latest version is ""pretty fine-tuned and well done"".Crucially, if Bold Glamour were indeed generative AI's latest iteration, it would mean that the filter depends on goldmines of data to deliver its increasingly perfect effects.This dependency on big data comes as the Chinese-owned firm is under intense scrutiny by the United States and other western governments that fear the company's ties to communist authorities in Beijing.""The question is whether TikTok is really concerned with the implications of this new shiny thing,"" said Selepak.Path to 'deep fake'Catfishing, scams, deep fakes: some wonder whether state-of-the-art filters are pointing to a world where the ability to misuse the technology is now at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone.The latest filters ""are not necessarily a deep fake technology as such, but there is a relatively straightforward path extending in that direction,"" said Somol.Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, said it was unlikely that the major platforms like TikTok or Meta-owned Instagram would knowingly provide dangerous tools.But ""what makes them more dangerous is people who understand the technology could change it to help users evade being identified online"", opening new avenues for misuse, he added.

Fears grow about AI scams: How concerned should you be?
Artificial intelligence coming to new iPhones, Windows laptops

As AI comes to more and more devices, many consumers are getting worried about scams and wrongdoing.  How concerned should you be?

and last updated
Apple's newest phone is expected to include a long list of artificial intelligence features.And while many consumers are embracing these new tools, others have concerns about AI and worry it will make it harder to identify potential scams.Avoiding it is getting tougher and tougher, as AI is coming to just about everything we use and touch, from the new iPhones to the next generation of laptops (featuring Microsoft's Windows Copilot), and perhaps even your next kitchen appliances.
Consumers have many concerns
If you have mixed feelings about AI, you're not alone.""It might help out,"" one woman sitting outside at lunch told us. ""Maybe, maybe not. But it's scary!""Patrick Bolling, also enjoying lunch on a nice September day, says he's uneasy.""I'm scared to death of it,"" Bolling said.Especially in an election year, he said, ""you can't trust anything, and you can't believe anything.""A new survey from the company Boss Revolution captures Americans' concerns about AI: 48 percent say they feel less ""scam-savvy.""And one in three admit it would be difficult to identify a potential scam, if an AI scammer tried to impersonate someone they know.""The biggest danger right now is that your average American, still, even if they're afraid of AI, does not know how good this technology has gotten,"" said Mike Kaput of the Marketing AI Institute.He has a caution for consumers.""I can tell you to keep your eyes open and remain aware,"" Kaput said, ""but you can still get fooled very easily.""Worries about financial scamsIn the survey, the majority of respondents (69 percent) believe AI will have a major impact on financial scams.AI helps scammers come up with much more convincing emails and text messages, according to Zulfikar Ramzan with the software company Aura.""Nowadays, we're seeing more and more messages with impeccable grammar, no errors. Everything looks copacetic,"" Ramzan said.Kaput admits AI does have risks, but insists it's not all doom and gloom.""Despite the scary parts of it, there's so many ways where it can vastly improve your daily life or the work that you do,"" Kaput said.Boss Revolution's survey finds 38 percent of people are likely to use AI for everyday tasks.Best Buy's Seph Swaenepoel agrees, telling us there's no need to be scared of the AI on the newest Windows laptops, for instance.""Everybody could benefit from having an assistant, essentially,"" he said.That way you're using AI for good, and you don't waste your money._______________________________________""Don't Waste Your Money"" is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc.

The news outlets took the step to stop OpenAI company from using their content to train its AI models.   While NYT was among the first known publishers to block the GPTBot from accessing its content, other publications are following suit in disallowing the web crawler, a report from The Guardian said.  OpenAI shot to fame after it released its artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.

Revoliucinis orų prognozavimas: „Google“ AI modelis lenkia vyriausybės modelius
  ByVicky Stavropoulou

Lapkritis 14, 2023
  A groundbreaking study published in Science revealed that Google’s new AI-powered weather prediction model has consistently outperformed existing government models and exhibited unmatched accuracy, even surpassing the widely acclaimed European model. This AI model, named “GraphCast” and developed by Google DeepMind, outshined traditional forecasting methods in predicting day-to-day weather patterns and extreme events like hurricanes and extreme temperatures.Traditionally, weather models employed by organizations like the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) rely on complex mathematical equations. These models, although reliable, demand substantial computing power and can be expensive to operate.Contrasting this approach, AI-based models like GraphCast undergo a distinct training process. They analyze extensive historical weather data to recognize patterns and then utilize this knowledge to generate forecasts based on present conditions. With significantly lower computational requirements, AI models achieve highly accurate predictions within minutes or even seconds.GraphCast, trained on nearly four decades of historical data, generates 10-day forecasts at six-hour intervals for locations across the globe in less than a minute. In comparison, traditional models take over an hour to accomplish the same task on a supercomputer the size of a school bus. Impressively, GraphCast surpassed the European model in terms of accuracy for over 90% of the evaluated weather variables.While this study showcases the immense potential of AI models, experts emphasize that they are not ready to replace traditional forecasting methods entirely. Aaron Hill, lead developer of Colorado State University’s machine learning prediction system, welcomes GraphCast as an addition to the growing list of AI-based weather prediction models that require continued evaluation for various applications.Although AI models like GraphCast have piqued the interest of government weather agencies due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, challenges remain before their widespread use in operational forecasting. AI models currently lack the ability to forecast certain parameters or phenomena at smaller scales, limiting their utility in predicting localized weather events such as thunderstorms and flash flooding. Furthermore, the transparency of AI models poses a challenge, as forecasters must have a thorough understanding of the model’s inner workings to establish trust.In conclusion, while Google’s AI model demonstrates remarkable accuracy and speed in weather prediction, it complements, rather than replaces, traditional forecasting methods.

Artificial Intelligence Detects Biological Signals in Ancient Samples with 90% Accuracy
  ByGabriel Botha

Sep 26, 2023
Scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) method that can detect subtle differences in molecular patterns indicative of biological signals in ancient samples. This breakthrough brings hope for the detection of life on other planets. The AI system, which was trained using 134 samples, successfully identified biotic samples and distinguished them from abiotic systems with 90% accuracy.The researchers believe that the chemistry of life differs fundamentally from that of inanimate matter, and that there are “chemical rules of life” that influence the diversity and distribution of biomolecules. By deducing these rules, scientists can detect subtle signs of life on other worlds. The AI method relies on the idea that biomolecules retain information about the chemical processes that produced them. Therefore, if life exists on other planets, it is likely to exhibit similar distinctive patterns that can be quantified using AI.This new method has the potential to be embedded in the sensors of future robotic space explorers, such as landers and rovers on the moon and Mars. It could also be used on spacecraft that orbit potentially habitable worlds like Enceladus and Europa. Detecting signs of life on other planets is a complex task, as organic molecules indicative of life degrade over time.In addition to its potential for extraterrestrial exploration, the AI method can be used to study ancient samples on Earth. For example, it can be employed to analyze the 3.5 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia, which are thought to hold the world’s oldest fossils. The presence of bacteria in these rocks would suggest that life thrived on Earth much earlier than previously believed.This research offers exciting possibilities for the field of astrobiology. By combining artificial intelligence with advanced sensors, scientists may be one step closer to solving the age-old question: are we alone in the universe?Imithombo:

Social Security Scams Could Become More Prevalent Thanks to AI — Here’s Why

Social Security scams soared in recent years due to the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasingly sophisticated technologies. According to FBI data, Americans 60 and older reported $3.1 billion in scam losses in 2022 alone  — a whopping 84% gain from the previous year. That growth rate could push even higher in coming years now that fraudsters have discovered the wonders of artificial intelligence.
AI has proven particularly useful in helping scammers steal Social Security numbers and benefits, according to Amanda D’Amico, vice president of risk and fraud strategy & operations at Thomson Reuters.


“In the last few years, we have seen an explosion of the use of advanced technology by criminal actors to commit fraud and financial crimes targeting government benefit programs, including Social Security,” D’Amico told Forbes in a recent interview. “The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and its open availability presents the perfect opportunity for criminals to up their tech game once again.”
And the elderly are particularly susceptible, experts say.
“[Seniors] are prime targets as they typically have some form of accumulated savings or retirement and they tend to be less technologically savvy,” David Derigiotis, an author and chief insurance officer for Embroker, told Newsweek. “Verifying the legitimacy of communications from federal programs, such as Social Security, is crucial to avoid falling for a scam.”

Are You Retirement Ready?

The number of fraud complaints involving seniors totaled 88,262 in 2022, according to the FBI. The average loss per victim was $35,101. A total of 5,456 victims lost more than $100,000.
So how does AI make it easier for fraudsters to steal from Social Security recipients?
Part of it has to do with their ability to change identities on social media platforms and other sites. Here is what D’Amico told Forbes:
AI helps criminals search through personal records to create phony Social Security accounts.
Fraudsters can use AI-generated video to pose as public figures, like the president or other elected officials, by using the technology to adopt their likenesses. From there, victims are scammed into providing personal information.
Artificial intelligence isn’t perfect, however. As D’Amico noted, the technology “has a hard time replicating teeth and hands,” which means you should keep an eye out for images where proportions seem too large or small. In addition, AI might mistakenly add or remove fingers.


“This is a major red flag that you are speaking to a bad actor,” D’Amico said. “Of course, this may be difficult for elderly folks who are hard of seeing, so always reach out to a friend or loved one for a second opinion.”
Another common scam involves impersonating Social Security Administration personnel in an attempt to obtain personal information or money, according to the SSA. Criminals might contact victims through phone calls, emails, texts or social media messages and provide AI-generated photos of real SSA employees.
Here are the four basic signs of a scam, the SSA said:
Scammers pretend to be from an agency or organization you know to gain your trust.
Scammers say there is a problem or a prize.
Scammers pressure you to act immediately.
Scammers tell you to pay in a specific way.

Are You Retirement Ready?

The best course of action is to ignore all of these messages. If you have any questions, call the SSA directly. If you suspect Social Security fraud, visit the SSA fraud prevention site, or call the fraud hotline at 800-269-0271.

Retirement / Social Security Social Security Scams Could Become More Prevalent Thanks to AI — Here’s Why 4 min Read December 11, 2023 By Vance Cariaga Ridofranz / iStock.com Social Security scams soared in recent years due to the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasingly sophisticated technologies. According to FBI data, Americans 60 and older reported $3.1 billion in scam losses in 2022 alone — a whopping 84% gain from the previous year. That growth rate could push even higher in coming years now that fraudsters have discovered the wonders of artificial intelligence. AI has proven particularly useful in helping scammers steal Social Security numbers and benefits, according to Amanda D’Amico, vice president of risk and fraud strategy & operations at Thomson Reuters. “In the last few years, we have seen an explosion of the use of advanced technology by criminal actors to commit fraud and financial crimes targeting government benefit programs, including Social Security,” D’Amico told Forbes in a recent interview. “The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and its open availability presents the perfect opportunity for criminals to up their tech game once again.” And the elderly are particularly susceptible, experts say. “[Seniors] are prime targets as they typically have some form of accumulated savings or retirement and they tend to be less technologically savvy,” David Derigiotis, an author and chief insurance officer for Embroker, told Newsweek. “Verifying the legitimacy of communications from federal programs, such as Social Security, is crucial to avoid falling for a scam.” Are You Retirement Ready? The number of fraud complaints involving seniors totaled 88,262 in 2022, according to the FBI. The average loss per victim was $35,101. A total of 5,456 victims lost more than $100,000. So how does AI make it easier for fraudsters to steal from Social Security recipients? Part of it has to do with their ability to change identities on social media platforms and other sites. Here is what D’Amico told Forbes: AI helps criminals search through personal records to create phony Social Security accounts. Fraudsters can use AI-generated video to pose as public figures, like the president or other elected officials, by using the technology to adopt their likenesses. From there, victims are scammed into providing personal information. Artificial intelligence isn’t perfect, however. As D’Amico noted, the technology “has a hard time replicating teeth and hands,” which means you should keep an eye out for images where proportions seem too large or small. In addition, AI might mistakenly add or remove fingers. “This is a major red flag that you are speaking to a bad actor,” D’Amico said. “Of course, this may be difficult for elderly folks who are hard of seeing, so always reach out to a friend or loved one for a second opinion.” Another common scam involves impersonating Social Security Administration personnel in an attempt to obtain personal information or money, according to the SSA. Criminals might contact victims through phone calls, emails, texts or social media messages and provide AI-generated photos of real SSA employees. Here are the four basic signs of a scam, the SSA said: Scammers pretend to be from an agency or organization you know to gain your trust. Scammers say there is a problem or a prize. Scammers pressure you to act immediately. Scammers tell you to pay in a specific way. Are You Retirement Ready? The best course of action is to ignore all of these messages. If you have any questions, call the SSA directly. If you suspect Social Security fraud, visit the SSA fraud prevention site, or call the fraud hotline at 800-269-0271.

Eckleburg serves as the backend intelligence engine behind all Ubiety product and service offerings across the residential, commercial and community security and safety industries.Ubiety's groundbreaking AI, Eckleburg, translates radio frequency signals from wireless devices all around us into data and insights. Image made with Midjourney.(PRNewswire)The result of several years' investment of R&D, Eckleburg is Ubiety's custom developed AI platform that is purpose built to consume high velocity radio frequency data streaming from the RF signals emitted by digital devices in an area. Eckleburg combines a state of the art data streaming capability built on the latest cutting edge technology with advanced Machine Learning algorithms trained on Ubiety's internal and proprietary data sets to produce a set of 'presence detection' capabilities that no one else in the world can offer today. Eckleburg's first assignment was to distill an overwhelming 'wall of noise' of RF data down into a set of meaningful and actionable insights in near real time. Since its inception, we've also grown and modularized Eckleburg so that it can add different types of data to expand its insights in new areas.Eckleburg is ingesting high velocity data in real-time from several different wireless protocols (e.g. cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth) emitted by a wide range of devices including mobile phones, laptops & tablets, smart devices, wearables, and many other IoT devices. In each unique deployment, Eckleburg is able to learn and establish known devices and what represents 'normal' activity patterns in order to identify anomalies and generate alerts based on the traffic it observes. The custom graph structure for data processing in Eckleburg allows us to make multiple predictions and inferences about each unique packet of data that flows through the network. Combining the insights from each node of the network and all individual predictions allows us to critically score the value for every potential alert and only relay the most important information to the end user.In residential security and awareness, Eckleburg can detect anomalous devices entering a home that don't belong. For example, if all members of a family use Apple iPhones and a Samsung phone enters the home, Eckleburg alerts the homeowner to an unknown device without requiring that device to connect to their WiFi. Similarly, if parents are out for the evening and expect their two children to remain home, but Eckleburg recognizes there are 6 additional phones present, Eckleburg alerts the homeowner. And critically - all of this is possible without installing cameras or microphones in the home.""I am extremely proud to release the next generation of Ubiety's Artificial Intelligence engine into the residential and commercial security markets. Existing AI products in security are not capturing the vast dataset available from Radio Frequency emitting devices and Eckleburg is the first solution to bridge that gap"" said Joe Loftus, Director of Data Science at Ubiety. ""We have internally trained a set of Machine Learning models to accomplish a wide range of tasks such as device categorization and classification, device counting, and anomaly detection. Our Artificial Intelligence capabilities allow us to build a complete profile of device presence and human activity purely by analyzing passive RF signals. This produces a unique and valuable set of insights that would otherwise be invisible and be ignored by any other offering in the market today. We believe that these insights will augment traditional security and smart home systems and will greatly enhance both the customer experience and the efficacy of conventional physical security offerings.""Mik Cox, Ubiety's Chief Technology Officer, added ""Eckleburg is built on some of the world's most advanced ML and streaming tools, including cutting-edge open source platforms that are used by over 80% of the Fortune 100 and are developed rapidly and collaboratively by dozens of the world's most innovative tech companies. The Ubiety team purposefully built Eckleburg to be a high throughput, high availability, and highly scalable platform for real-time stream processing, and watching its evolution over the past couple years has been staggering. I believe that Eckleburg's capabilities will act as a catalyst to the security industry, expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Combining existing industry data with Ubiety's novel RF detection and AI insights will unlock a host of new features never before seen in the security and IoT industries.""Keith Puckett, Ubiety's CEO said: ""The security ecosystem has historically only had access to binary, blind alerts - things like motion sensors, door/window contact sensors, glass break detection, or video camera technology. All of these input methods can be extremely valuable, but often lack crucial context about what is actually happening, and do not generate situational awareness in an automated, scalable manner. For example, video cameras are terrific tools, but still often require a human in the loop or heavy video processing algorithms for interpretation - both of which are subject to error and bias. Additionally, OEMs, security dealers, and monitoring centers are aiming to adhere to updated industry standards such as TMA AVS-01.""Nacho Andrade, Ubiety's Chief Product Officer shared his perspective: ""Innovation in the security industry has been very video-centric in recent years, and while these solutions have unlocked a ton of value, they have left other areas unexplored. While we see Eckleburg making a transformative impact on residential security today, it's really only the tip of the iceberg for what is possible. Eckleburg was designed to work with many types of data, this means we can plug in information available from security solutions today to do even more amazing things. Eckleburg could 'see' that the residents left the house, but the smart door locks aren't engaged. In that situation we could automatically lock the doors and arm the security system. The products we are building at Ubiety are the types of innovations that product people dream about, where instead of trying to carefully craft a use case to fit the technology, one of the biggest challenges we face is deciding which use case to tackle first""Eckleburg is the backbone that powers Ubiety's product offerings, HomeAware and SignalWise. From the moment a customer enables their Ubiety solution, Eckleburg will begin to learn from the local signaling environment, and after an initial ""learning and settling"" period, begins to generate meaningful insights and security alerts based on observed behavior. As we continue to build and develop new features on top of Eckleburg we look forward to expanding the capabilities to ingest new sources of data and create an even more holistic picture of presence and context. In the future we are building there will be far fewer unknowns to the anxious homeowner when they receive an urgent call from their security provider.

This is why Fyusion, a visual intelligence company owned by Cox Automotive, has delivered a powerful new open-source library that makes it easy and efficient to run machine learning models on almost any mobile device. Now available on GitHub, this lightweight yet powerful software library called FyuseNet can take a wide variety of machine learning models and write incredibly fast implementation for whichever platform the developer chooses—all while maintaining a lean application.Cox Automotive (PRNewsfoto/Cox Automotive)(PRNewswire)""At Fyusion, we live at the intersection of high-tech research and pragmatic engineering, bringing big ideas to life in a way that can truly benefit people around us,"" said Stephen Miller, Fyusion Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. ""We know how powerful FyuseNet is, as we've used it for years in our own work, and we believe that this can be the one beautiful library that everyone uses to accelerate advancements in machine learning.""With stark differences between operating systems, as well as fragmentation across older and newer generations of phones, creating machine learning models for mobile phones has been notoriously inefficient. This has led to innovations mostly being reserved for the $1,000+ flagship phones that are out of the reach of many people.However, the team at Fyusion is on a mission to democratize machine learning and ensure that these technologies are more accessible to more people. That's why it was important to them to open access to FyuseNet, as its lightweight implementation makes it compatible with the majority of devices—regardless of manufacturer or specific processor details—even when there's no network connectivity available. Created in 2016 for internal use, FyuseNet has been iterated on for years within Fyusion before making its inaugural appearance on GitHub this year.The Technical Details:FyuseNet is an OpenGL(ES) based library that enables the running of neural network inference on GPUs that support OpenGL and OpenGL(ES). The library was written in portable C++ and runs on a variety of desktop, edge and mobile platforms. FyuseNet is made freely available under the MIT License.In order to deliver the performance required to run in real-time, the developers integrated a number of tweaks into the library, with the most important being the ability to fuse some operations in a single layer/shader. A second trick that FyuseNet employs is to make use of the raster operation processors of the GPU. This has the added benefit of getting some arithmetic operations essentially for free, as it does not change execution time within the shader. The runtime has no notable external dependency aside from OpenGL, so users get clean, simple, extremely portable code.""When we founded Fyusion, one of our goals was to take our team's immense technical expertise and use it to solve real world problems facing everyday people,"" added Radu Rusu, Fyusion Co-Founder and CEO. ""And since innovations in machine learning happen quickly, we believe that making FyuseNet freely available will help us build a wider community of developers who can collectively contribute as discoveries are made and ensure that even more people can benefit from it for years to come.""Based in San Francisco, Fyusion employs some of the world's top researchers and developers in machine learning and AI, helping customers view and analyze millions of 3D automotive images every year.

But what happened next was terrifying. (Source: KPHO)By Susan Campbell and Emily Van de RietPublished: Apr. 10, 2023 at 5:31 PM EDT|Updated: 2 hours agoShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (KPHO/Gray News) – A mother in Arizona is warning others about a terrifying phone scam involving artificial intelligence that can clone a loved one’s voice.Jennifer DeStefano said she got a call from an unfamiliar phone number and almost let it go to voicemail. However, her 15-year-old daughter was out of town skiing, so she picked up the phone, fearing maybe there had been an accident.“I pick up the phone and I hear my daughter’s voice, and it says, ‘Mom!’ and she’s sobbing,” DeStefano recalled. “I said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘Mom, I messed up,’ and she’s sobbing and crying.”DeStefano said she then heard a man’s voice say, “Put your head back, lie down.”DeStefano’s confusion turned to terror.“This man gets on the phone and he’s like, ‘Listen here. I’ve got your daughter. This is how it’s going to go down. You call the police, you call anybody, I’m going to pop her so full of drugs. I’m going to have my way with her and I’m going to drop her off in Mexico,’” DeStefano recalled. “And at that moment, I just started shaking. In the background she’s going, ‘Help me, Mom. Please help me. Help me,’ and bawling.”The man on the phone then demanded money, first asking for $1 million, then lowering his demand to $50,000 when DeStefano said she did not have the funds.DeStefano kept him talking. During the phone call, she happened to be at her other daughter’s dance studio, surrounded by worried moms who wanted to help. One called 911, and another called DeStefano’s husband.Within just four minutes, they confirmed her daughter was safe.“She was upstairs in her room going, ‘What? What’s going on?’” DeStefano said. “Then I get angry, obviously, with these guys. This is not something you play around with.”Once she realized her daughter was safe, DeStefano hung up. But there had been no doubt in DeStefano’s mind that it was her daughter’s voice on the phone.“It was completely her voice. It was her inflection. It was the way she would have cried,” she said. “I never doubted for one second it was her. That’s the freaky part that really got me to my core.”But it turns out, the 15-year-old never said any of it. The voice on the phone was just a clone created by artificial intelligence.Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University specializing in AI, said voice cloning technology is rapidly improving.“You can no longer trust your ears,” Kambhampati said.Previously, cloning a voice would take a large number of samples from the person who was being cloned. Nowadays, Kambhampati said a voice can be cloned with just three seconds of your voice.“And with the three seconds, it can come close to how exactly you sound,” Kambhampati said. “Most of the voice cloning actually captures the inflection as well as the emotion.”Deep learning technology currently has very little oversight, and according to Kambhampati, it is becoming easier to access and use.“It’s a new toy, and I think there could be good uses, but certainly there can be pretty worrisome uses too,” he said.Dan Mayo, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Phoenix office, said scammers who use voice cloning technology often find their prey on social media.To avoid becoming a victim of scams like this, Mayo urges everyone to keep their profiles on private mode and not visible to the public.“You’ve got to keep that stuff locked down. The problem is, if you have it public, you’re allowing yourself to be scammed by people like this, because they’re going to be looking for public profiles that have as much information as possible on you, and when they get a hold of that, they’re going to dig into you,” Mayo said.According to the Federal Trade Commission, scammers will often ask victims to wire money, send cryptocurrency or pay ransom with gift cards. Once the money is transferred, getting it back is almost impossible.Mayo said red flags to look for include the phone number coming from an area code that you’re not familiar with, the phone number being an international number, and the person on the phone not allowing you to talk to other family members for help.“Just think of the movies. Slow it down. Slow the person down. Ask a bunch of questions,” Mayo said. “If they have someone of interest to you, you’re going to know a lot of details about them that this scam artist isn’t going to know. You start asking questions about who it is and different details of their background that are not publicly available, you’re going to find out real quick that it’s a scam artist.”It’s unknown how many people have received similar scam calls about a family emergency or fake kidnapping using an AI voice clone, but Mayo said it “happens on a daily basis,” but not everyone reports the call.Mayo said he believes people are so relieved that their family members are safe that they forget to report the scam.“However, there are some people who give in to these and they end up sending the money to these individuals,” Mayo said. “Trust me, the FBI is looking into these people, and we find them.”As for DeStefano, she’s thankful she didn’t send the scammers any money, but that didn’t stop her from being traumatized.“I literally just sat down and broke down crying,” she said. “They were tears for all of the what ifs. It all just seemed so real.”Copyright 2023 KPHO via Gray Media Group, Inc.

(KPHO/Gray News) – A mother in Arizona is warning others about a terrifying phone scam involving artificial intelligence that can clone a loved one’s voice.Jennifer DeStefano said she got a call from an unfamiliar phone number and almost let it go to voicemail. However, her 15-year-old daughter was out of town skiing, so she picked up the phone, fearing maybe there had been an accident.“I pick up the phone and I hear my daughter’s voice, and it says, ‘Mom!’ and she’s sobbing,” DeStefano recalled. “I said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘Mom, I messed up,’ and she’s sobbing and crying.”DeStefano said she then heard a man’s voice say, “Put your head back, lie down.”DeStefano’s confusion turned to terror.“This man gets on the phone and he’s like, ‘Listen here. I’ve got your daughter. This is how it’s going to go down. You call the police, you call anybody, I’m going to pop her so full of drugs. I’m going to have my way with her and I’m going to drop her off in Mexico,’” DeStefano recalled. “And at that moment, I just started shaking. In the background she’s going, ‘Help me, Mom. Please help me. Help me,’ and bawling.”The man on the phone then demanded money, first asking for $1 million, then lowering his demand to $50,000 when DeStefano said she did not have the funds.DeStefano kept him talking.

Now Microsoft is making a big bet that they can be something much more: the future of knowledge work.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightAfter years of chasing Google in the AI race, the Redmond, Wash., software giant is hoping to leap ahead with big investments in OpenAI, the San Francisco-based start-up behind those tools. The company that once brought us Clippy, the endearingly unhelpful animated paper clip, is working on AI models that don’t just offer to help you format a letter, but can analyze your Excel spreadsheet, create AI art to illustrate your PowerPoint presentation, or even draft a whole email for you in Outlook. And that’s just for starters.On Monday, Microsoft launched an OpenAI service as part of its Azure cloud platform, offering businesses and start-ups the ability to incorporate models like ChatGPT into their own systems. The company has already been building AI tools into many of its consumer products, such as a DALL-E 2 feature in its Bing search engine that can create images based on a text prompt, and the Information reported recently that it’s working to bring more of them to Microsoft Office as well.AdvertisementEventually, CEO Satya Nadella said in Davos this week, “Every product of Microsoft will have some of the same AI capabilities.”The company is staking its claim to what many in the tech industry believe will be an AI revolution. Microsoft is one of several, including rival Google, betting that this generation of artificial intelligence will transform not just productivity software but entire industries, thanks to so-called large language models that can understand, converse with, and imitate humans in realms ranging from writing to art to computer coding.“I think this is going to radically change the future for all knowledge work,” said Bojan Tunguz, a machine learning modeler and data scientist at Nvidia, of the recent advances in large language models. “We’re only seeing the early days of what that entails.”AdvertisementThat’s the bullish view, and it’s one that you’ll hear a lot in Silicon Valley and Seattle these days. While Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants have been testing and honing AI models for years, a new crop of risk-taking upstarts has stolen their thunder by taking their experimental AI programs directly to the public. The release of tools like ChatGPT, DALLE-2, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion and Midjourney in the past year has made “generative AI” — software that draws on vast data sets to create novel works — the industry’s buzziest byword.Now that they’ve caught on, Big Tech is playing catch-up. And no one’s playing it harder than Microsoft.At Davos, Nadella predicted that the current generation of AI will spark an industry-wide “platform shift” on par with the moves to mobile devices and cloud computing over the past 15 years. Microsoft, which was an early investor in OpenAI, is reportedly planning to take a much larger ownership stake in the company in what could be a $10 billion deal, the news site Semafor first reported last week. Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment.AdvertisementThere’s also a skeptical view, in which the technology proves dazzling as a toy and a novelty but underwhelming or even harmful in its practical applications.ChatGPT can produce remarkably plausible-sounding text on a wide range of topics, but it’s prone to factual errors and problematic biases, and some school districts have already banned it as a potential cheating tool. The tech news site CNET is under fire for quietly using AI to write articles, some of which were found to contain errors. Stability AI, the maker of AI art generator Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images for allegedly training its model on copyrighted works without permission. Microsoft has its own history of AI missteps, including the 2016 release of a chatbot called Tay that trolls trained to embrace genocidal hatred.Those risks help to explain why Google, which has developed some of the most advanced AI chat tools, has yet to release them to the public. Google’s LaMDA chatbot system is so sophisticated that one of the company’s engineers became convinced it was sentient, reigniting a debate over whether it would be irresponsible to make similar tools available to ordinary users.Advertisement“Some people are going to get hurt — that’s inevitable,” said Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Thursday at a forum hosted by the company Collective[i]. That shouldn’t stop the march of progress, he added, but it is important for companies involved in developing new forms of AI to find ways to mitigate the damage.Downplaying ChatGPT as “just nicely done, not revolutionary,” LeCun suggested that the reason it came from a start-up rather than a tech giant is because “Google and Meta both have a lot to lose by putting out a system that makes stuff up.” (In November, Meta released a language model for scientists, called Galactica, only to pull the plug on it three days later due to a backlash.)Still, Microsoft’s embrace of OpenAI puts renewed pressure on its rivals, particularly in the lucrative cloud computing sector. While using ChatGPT to improve its own products could help Microsoft hold its edge in productivity software, the larger battle is to sell AI services to businesses. Those could include established firms looking to build a smarter customer-service chatbot, start-ups developing more specialized AI tools, or even other AI companies that need cloud computing power to train their own models.AdvertisementOne application that’s already gaining traction is the use of AI to assist software developers in writing code. Microsoft’s subsidiary GitHub uses OpenAI technology in a tool called GitHub Copilot, which can suggest code in real time as you’re programming.“Definitely Microsoft adopting it will make it a lot more widely available,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of the start-up Neeva, which recently introduced an AI-based search engine that uses language models to answer users’ questions directly. “The problem is, once Microsoft starts turning the screws on a particular area, they tend to squeeze out everybody else.”Ramaswamy, a former Google executive, predicted that Google will release its own chatbot in the next month or so, “and it’ll be very good.” But in the long run, he said he doubts Microsoft or Google will be able to corner the market.Advertisement“The tech is rapidly getting commoditized,” Ramaswamy said, with start-ups such as Anthropic and Cohere already building their own tools and models. “Start-ups can afford to take risks, because they have a lot less to lose. I think that’s going to be an issue with Google and Microsoft.”On Friday, Google’s parent company cut 12,000 jobs, as CEO Sundar Pichai told the remaining employees that the company would sharpen its focus on AI. Earlier this week, Google AI guru Jeff Dean published a blog post highlighting the company’s latest work on large language models, and the New York Times reported that the company has called on its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to review its AI strategy.Meanwhile, Microsoft’s big moves in AI lend the 47-year-old company an air of excitement at a time when gloom pervades the tech sector. Microsoft announced its own cuts on Wednesday, following rounds of layoffs by Amazon, Meta and others. But its aggressive AI investments could give its remaining employees — and future recruits — a reason for optimism.To deliver on that promise, it will have to show that it can turn its shiny new AI tools into something more consequential than Clippy 2.0.

That shouldn’t stop the march of progress, he added, but it is important for companies involved in developing new forms of AI to find ways to mitigate the damage.Downplaying ChatGPT as “just nicely done, not revolutionary,” LeCun suggested that the reason it came from a start-up rather than a tech giant is because “Google and Meta both have a lot to lose by putting out a system that makes stuff up.” (In November, Meta released a language model for scientists, called Galactica, only to pull the plug on it three days later due to a backlash.)Still, Microsoft’s embrace of OpenAI puts renewed pressure on its rivals, particularly in the lucrative cloud computing sector. While using ChatGPT to improve its own products could help Microsoft hold its edge in productivity software, the larger battle is to sell AI services to businesses. Those could include established firms looking to build a smarter customer-service chatbot, start-ups developing more specialized AI tools, or even other AI companies that need cloud computing power to train their own models.AdvertisementOne application that’s already gaining traction is the use of AI to assist software developers in writing code. Microsoft’s subsidiary GitHub uses OpenAI technology in a tool called GitHub Copilot, which can suggest code in real time as you’re programming.“Definitely Microsoft adopting it will make it a lot more widely available,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of the start-up Neeva, which recently introduced an AI-based search engine that uses language models to answer users’ questions directly. “The problem is, once Microsoft starts turning the screws on a particular area, they tend to squeeze out everybody else.”Ramaswamy, a former Google executive, predicted that Google will release its own chatbot in the next month or so, “and it’ll be very good.” But in the long run, he said he doubts Microsoft or Google will be able to corner the market.Advertisement“The tech is rapidly getting commoditized,” Ramaswamy said, with start-ups such as Anthropic and Cohere already building their own tools and models. “Start-ups can afford to take risks, because they have a lot less to lose. I think that’s going to be an issue with Google and Microsoft.”On Friday, Google’s parent company cut 12,000 jobs, as CEO Sundar Pichai told the remaining employees that the company would sharpen its focus on AI. Earlier this week, Google AI guru Jeff Dean published a blog post highlighting the company’s latest work on large language models, and the New York Times reported that the company has called on its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to review its AI strategy.Meanwhile, Microsoft’s big moves in AI lend the 47-year-old company an air of excitement at a time when gloom pervades the tech sector. Microsoft announced its own cuts on Wednesday, following rounds of layoffs by Amazon, Meta and others. But its aggressive AI investments could give its remaining employees — and future recruits — a reason for optimism.To deliver on that promise, it will have to show that it can turn its shiny new AI tools into something more consequential than Clippy 2.0.

Microsoft’s new killer app is ChatGPT.The Seattle giant is making a big, risky bet on the trendiest new AI tools.Analysis by Will OremusStaff writer January 21, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. ESTMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella says AI language models will be the tech industry's next big platform. (Elaine Thompson/AP)ListenComment on this storyCommentGift ArticleShareNew artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 have gone viral as free, online toys that anyone can use to generate text or art. Now Microsoft is making a big bet that they can be something much more: the future of knowledge work.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightAfter years of chasing Google in the AI race, the Redmond, Wash., software giant is hoping to leap ahead with big investments in OpenAI, the San Francisco-based start-up behind those tools. The company that once brought us Clippy, the endearingly unhelpful animated paper clip, is working on AI models that don’t just offer to help you format a letter, but can analyze your Excel spreadsheet, create AI art to illustrate your PowerPoint presentation, or even draft a whole email for you in Outlook. And that’s just for starters.On Monday, Microsoft launched an OpenAI service as part of its Azure cloud platform, offering businesses and start-ups the ability to incorporate models like ChatGPT into their own systems. The company has already been building AI tools into many of its consumer products, such as a DALL-E 2 feature in its Bing search engine that can create images based on a text prompt, and the Information reported recently that it’s working to bring more of them to Microsoft Office as well.AdvertisementEventually, CEO Satya Nadella said in Davos this week, “Every product of Microsoft will have some of the same AI capabilities.”The company is staking its claim to what many in the tech industry believe will be an AI revolution. Microsoft is one of several, including rival Google, betting that this generation of artificial intelligence will transform not just productivity software but entire industries, thanks to so-called large language models that can understand, converse with, and imitate humans in realms ranging from writing to art to computer coding.“I think this is going to radically change the future for all knowledge work,” said Bojan Tunguz, a machine learning modeler and data scientist at Nvidia, of the recent advances in large language models. “We’re only seeing the early days of what that entails.”AdvertisementThat’s the bullish view, and it’s one that you’ll hear a lot in Silicon Valley and Seattle these days. While Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants have been testing and honing AI models for years, a new crop of risk-taking upstarts has stolen their thunder by taking their experimental AI programs directly to the public. The release of tools like ChatGPT, DALLE-2, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion and Midjourney in the past year has made “generative AI” — software that draws on vast data sets to create novel works — the industry’s buzziest byword.Now that they’ve caught on, Big Tech is playing catch-up. And no one’s playing it harder than Microsoft.At Davos, Nadella predicted that the current generation of AI will spark an industry-wide “platform shift” on par with the moves to mobile devices and cloud computing over the past 15 years. Microsoft, which was an early investor in OpenAI, is reportedly planning to take a much larger ownership stake in the company in what could be a $10 billion deal, the news site Semafor first reported last week. Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment.AdvertisementThere’s also a skeptical view, in which the technology proves dazzling as a toy and a novelty but underwhelming or even harmful in its practical applications.ChatGPT can produce remarkably plausible-sounding text on a wide range of topics, but it’s prone to factual errors and problematic biases, and some school districts have already banned it as a potential cheating tool. The tech news site CNET is under fire for quietly using AI to write articles, some of which were found to contain errors. Stability AI, the maker of AI art generator Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images for allegedly training its model on copyrighted works without permission. Microsoft has its own history of AI missteps, including the 2016 release of a chatbot called Tay that trolls trained to embrace genocidal hatred.Those risks help to explain why Google, which has developed some of the most advanced AI chat tools, has yet to release them to the public. Google’s LaMDA chatbot system is so sophisticated that one of the company’s engineers became convinced it was sentient, reigniting a debate over whether it would be irresponsible to make similar tools available to ordinary users.Advertisement“Some people are going to get hurt — that’s inevitable,” said Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Thursday at a forum hosted by the company Collective[i].

How ChatGPT is changing the cybersecurity game 


The cybersecurity industry can leverage GPT-3 potential as a co-pilot to help defeat attackers, according to Sophos. 

The latest report details projects developed by Sophos X-Ops using GPT-3’s large language models to simplify the search for malicious activity in datasets from security software, more accurately filter spam, and speed up analysis of “living off the land” binary (LOLBin) attacks. 
“Since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT back in November, the security community has largely focused on the potential risks this new technology could bring. Can the AI help wannabee attackers write malware or help cybercriminals write much more convincing phishing emails? Perhaps, but, at Sophos, we’ve long seen AI as an ally rather than an enemy for defenders, making it a cornerstone technology for Sophos, and GPT-3 is no different. The security community should be paying attention not just to the potential risks, but the potential opportunities GPT-3 brings,” said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher, Sophos.
ChatGPT cybersecurity potential
Sophos X-Ops researchers, including SophosAI Principal Data Scientist Younghoo Lee, have been working on three prototype projects that demonstrate the potential of GPT-3 as an assistant to cybersecurity defenders. All three use a technique called “few-shot learning” to train the AI model with just a few data samples, reducing the need to collect a large volume of pre-classified data. 
The first application Sophos tested with the few-shot learning method was a natural language query interface for sifting through malicious activity in security software telemetry. Sophos tested the model against its endpoint detection and response product. With this interface, defenders can filter through the telemetry with basic English commands, removing the need for defenders to understand SQL or a database’s underlying structure. 
GPT-3 can simplify certain labor-intensive processes
Next, Sophos tested a new spam filter using ChatGPT and found that, when compared to other machine learning models for spam filtering, the filter using GPT-3 was significantly more accurate. 
Finally, Sophos researchers were able to create a program to simplify the process for reverse-engineering the command lines of LOLBins. Such reverse-engineering is notoriously difficult, but also critical for understanding LOLBins’ behavior—and putting a stop to those types of attacks in the future.
“One of the growing concerns within security operation centers is the sheer amount of ‘noise’ coming in. There are just too many notifications and detections to sort through, and many companies are dealing with limited resources. We’ve proved that, with something like GPT-3, we can simplify certain labor-intensive processes and give back valuable time to defenders. We are already working on incorporating some of the prototypes above into our products, and we’ve made the results of our efforts available on our GitHub for those interested in testing GPT-3 in their own analysis environments. In the future, we believe that GPT-3 may very well become a standard co-pilot for security experts,” said Gallagher.

Q-CALC represents a bold initiative at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, with the goal of advancing the capabilities of AI and machine learning systems in handling datasets with complex correlations. This project, supported by Innovate UK, promises to revolutionise data analysis within the defence industry. Infleqtion will partner with QinetiQ, a leading defence company, on the project.Infleqtion (PRNewsfoto/Infleqtion)(PRNewswire)Q-CALC will provide the UK with a powerful sovereign capability in quantum machine learning that has a clear line-of-sight to improved prediction and decision-making for defence applications. During US trade delegation meetings in July, Infleqtion announced the expansion of its quantum software presence to the UK, alongside the launch of QECCO, an award for quantum optimization.The AI/ML market has grown rapidly in the past few years, significantly accelerating in the past few months. However, there are significant scaling challenges on the horizon. While the GPT-3 model took at least $4.6M to train, the GPT-4 model required over $100M. The scaling in training and runtime costs will become even more untenable for future models because the transformer technology underpinning GPT has costs that scale quadratically. This is both a barrier to progress in classical AI/ML as well as an exciting commercial opportunity for Q-CALC, which will enable longer context windows.The project draws on experts in quantum software, algorithmic implementation, and benchmarking, harnessing the capabilities of Infleqtion's Superstaq platform for enhanced solution quality on both real quantum hardware and advanced simulators.""The Q-CALC project is not just an exploration into the possibilities of quantum-enhanced AI, but a tangible step towards realising its potential in real-world applications,"" said Dr Timothy Ballance, GM of Infleqtion UK. ""By harnessing quantum contextuality, we're paving the way for more advanced and accurate data analysis solutions that can address the unique challenges faced by the defence industry.""""QinetiQ has been interested for several years in the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. We see this as a possible route to a breakthrough in challenging defence problems such as identifying targets of interest in complex data sets. We are looking forward to teaming with Infleqtion to investigate this promising area further,"" said Dr Gillian Marshall, QinetiQ's Senior Fellow for Quantum Technologies.Roger McKinlay, challenge director of Quantum Technologies at Innovate UK, said: ""This is a great example of how our funding attracts talent, private investment, new collaborations, and creative ideas with real commercial potential. This is an exciting addition to the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme.""As the UK takes strides to expand its quantum leadership, the Q-CALC project is set to position the nation as a pioneer in quantum-enhanced AI and machine learning. The project's success will not only advance the capabilities of defence data analysis but also contribute to the growth of the quantum technology sector, creating new revenue streams and high-skilled jobs.About InfleqtionInfleqtion delivers high-value quantum information precisely where it is needed.

Google Photos Revamps ‘Memories’, Now Powered by AI

Google Photos has launched an updated “Memories” view, aiming to offer users a more organized and interactive experience. The platform now utilizes artificial intelligence to chronologically categorize users’ significant moments, making it easier to view your photo memories from the past.
The new Memories view ensures that users’ cherished recollections do not disappear after viewing. Google Photos now offers the option to save and rename these memories while looking back.
With the introduction of the “Labs” feature, users have the opportunity to enlist AI’s help in naming their memories, saving users an extra step. However, it’s worth noting that this experimental feature is currently restricted to a select group of U.S. accounts.
Adding a social dimension to the experience, Google Photos has ensured that memories are not just for personal reflection but can also be shared. Users can effortlessly share their memories with loved ones, making it akin to sharing an album.
Additionally, as friends and family share photos and videos, the user’s “Memories” highlight reel will be automatically updated to incorporate these shared moments, ensuring that every significant memory finds its place.
Check out the video demos shared by Google Photos today on X–the new Memories view launches first in the US:

Google Photos always brings up memories that are better than the Photos app from Apple. Can’t wait to give this new feature a try. We’re not seeing it live in Canada yet but hopefully it shows up soon.

		Apple enters AI race with ambitions to overtake the early leaders	

			Apple is leaning on ChatGPT, made by the San Francisco startup OpenAI, to help make its virtual assistant Siri smarter and more helpful.		


					By Michael Liedtke | Associated Press							•

Published 2 hours ago 

 
NBC Universal, Inc.
Apple jumped into the race to bring generative artificial intelligence to the masses during its World Wide Developers Conference Monday that spotlighted an onslaught of features designed to soup up the iPhone, iPad and Mac.
And in a move befitting a company known for its marketing prowess, the AI technology coming as part of free software updates later this year, is being billed as “Apple Intelligence.”

Philadelphia news 24/7: Watch NBC10 free wherever you are

Even as it tried to put its own stamp on the hottest area of technology, Apple tacitly acknowledged it needed help to catch up with companies like Microsoft and Google, who have emerged as the early leaders in the AI field. Apple is leaning on ChatGPT, made by the San Francisco startup OpenAI, to help make its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri smarter and more helpful.
“All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence, it's personal intelligence, and it is the next big step for Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.

Siri's gateway to ChatGPT will be free to all iPhone users and made available on other Apple products once the option is baked into the next generation of Apple's operating systems. ChatGPT subscribers are supposed to be able to easily sync their existing accounts when using the iPhone, and should get more advanced features than free users would.
To herald the alliance with Apple, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat in the front row of the packed conference, which included developers attending from more than 60 countries worldwide.
“Think you will really like it,” Altman predicted in a post about their partnership with Apple.
Beyond giving Siri the ability to tap into ChatGPT's knowledge base. Apple is giving its 13-year-old virtual assistant an extensive makeover designed to make it more personable and versatile, even as it currently fields about 1.5 billion queries a day.

								Apple Intelligence on your iPhone probably requires an upgrade							
When Apple releases free updates to the software powering the iPhone and its other products this autumn, Siri will signal its presence with flashing lights along the edges of the display screen, and be able to handle hundreds of more tasks — including chores that may require tapping into third-party devices — than it can now, based on Monday's presentations.
The AI-packed updates coming to the next versions of Apple software are meant to enable the billions of people who use its devices to get more done in less time, while also giving them access to creative tools that could liven things up. For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed “Genmojis” on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey.
Monday's showcase seemed aimed at allaying concerns Apple might be losing its edge during the advent of AI technology that is expected to be as revolutionary as the 2007 invention of the Phone. Both Google and Samsung have already released smartphone models touting AI features as their main attractions while Apple has been stuck in an uncharacteristically extended slump in the company’s sales.
AI mania is the main reason that Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips underlying the technology, has seen its market value rocket from about $300 billion at the end of 2022 to about $3 trillion. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to surpass Apple as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Earlier this year, Microsoft also eclipsed the iPhone maker on the strength of its so-far successful push into AI.
Investors didn't seem as impressed with Apple's AI presentation as the crowd that came to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to see it. Apple's stock price declined nearly 2% in Monday's trading after Cook walked off the stage.
Despite that negative reaction, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives asserted that Apple is “taking the right path” in a research note that hailed the presentation as a “historical” day for a company that already has reshaped the tech industry and society.
Besides pulling AI tricks out of its toolbox, Apple also used the conference to confirm that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app that should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel.
The change, due out with the next version of iPhone's operating software won't eliminate the blue bubbles denoting texts originating from iPhones and the green bubbles marking text sent from Android devices — a distinction that has become a source of social stigma.
This marked the second straight year that Apple has created a stir at its developers conference by using it to usher in a trendy form of technology that other companies already are on the market with.
Last year, Apple provided an early look at its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, which wasn't released until early 2024. Nevertheless, Apple's push into mixed reality — with a twist that it bills as “spatial computing” — has raised hopes that there will be more consumer interest in this niche technology.
Part of that optimism stems from Apple's history of releasing technology later than others, then using sleek designs and slick marketing campaigns to overcome its tardy start.
Bringing more AI to the iPhone will likely raise privacy concerns — a topic that Apple has gone to great lengths to assure its loyal customers it can be trusted not to peer too deeply into their personal lives. Apple did talk extensively Monday about its efforts to build strong privacy protections and controls around its AI technology.
One way Apple is trying to convince consumers that the iPhone won't be used to spy on them is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called “the cloud.” Going down this route would also help protect Apple's profit margins because AI processing through the cloud is far more expensive than when it is run solely on a device.
Apple's AI “will be aware of your personal l data without collecting your personal data,” said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering.

Apple enters AI race with ambitions to overtake the early leaders Apple is leaning on ChatGPT, made by the San Francisco startup OpenAI, to help make its virtual assistant Siri smarter and more helpful. By Michael Liedtke | Associated Press • Published 2 hours ago NBC Universal, Inc. Apple jumped into the race to bring generative artificial intelligence to the masses during its World Wide Developers Conference Monday that spotlighted an onslaught of features designed to soup up the iPhone, iPad and Mac. And in a move befitting a company known for its marketing prowess, the AI technology coming as part of free software updates later this year, is being billed as “Apple Intelligence.” Philadelphia news 24/7: Watch NBC10 free wherever you are Even as it tried to put its own stamp on the hottest area of technology, Apple tacitly acknowledged it needed help to catch up with companies like Microsoft and Google, who have emerged as the early leaders in the AI field. Apple is leaning on ChatGPT, made by the San Francisco startup OpenAI, to help make its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri smarter and more helpful. “All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence, it's personal intelligence, and it is the next big step for Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.

Siri's gateway to ChatGPT will be free to all iPhone users and made available on other Apple products once the option is baked into the next generation of Apple's operating systems. ChatGPT subscribers are supposed to be able to easily sync their existing accounts when using the iPhone, and should get more advanced features than free users would. To herald the alliance with Apple, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat in the front row of the packed conference, which included developers attending from more than 60 countries worldwide. “Think you will really like it,” Altman predicted in a post about their partnership with Apple.

The AI-packed updates coming to the next versions of Apple software are meant to enable the billions of people who use its devices to get more done in less time, while also giving them access to creative tools that could liven things up. For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed “Genmojis” on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey. Monday's showcase seemed aimed at allaying concerns Apple might be losing its edge during the advent of AI technology that is expected to be as revolutionary as the 2007 invention of the Phone. Both Google and Samsung have already released smartphone models touting AI features as their main attractions while Apple has been stuck in an uncharacteristically extended slump in the company’s sales. AI mania is the main reason that Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips underlying the technology, has seen its market value rocket from about $300 billion at the end of 2022 to about $3 trillion. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to surpass Apple as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Earlier this year, Microsoft also eclipsed the iPhone maker on the strength of its so-far successful push into AI. Investors didn't seem as impressed with Apple's AI presentation as the crowd that came to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to see it. Apple's stock price declined nearly 2% in Monday's trading after Cook walked off the stage. Despite that negative reaction, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives asserted that Apple is “taking the right path” in a research note that hailed the presentation as a “historical” day for a company that already has reshaped the tech industry and society. Besides pulling AI tricks out of its toolbox, Apple also used the conference to confirm that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app that should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel. The change, due out with the next version of iPhone's operating software won't eliminate the blue bubbles denoting texts originating from iPhones and the green bubbles marking text sent from Android devices — a distinction that has become a source of social stigma. This marked the second straight year that Apple has created a stir at its developers conference by using it to usher in a trendy form of technology that other companies already are on the market with. Last year, Apple provided an early look at its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, which wasn't released until early 2024. Nevertheless, Apple's push into mixed reality — with a twist that it bills as “spatial computing” — has raised hopes that there will be more consumer interest in this niche technology. Part of that optimism stems from Apple's history of releasing technology later than others, then using sleek designs and slick marketing campaigns to overcome its tardy start. Bringing more AI to the iPhone will likely raise privacy concerns — a topic that Apple has gone to great lengths to assure its loyal customers it can be trusted not to peer too deeply into their personal lives. Apple did talk extensively Monday about its efforts to build strong privacy protections and controls around its AI technology. One way Apple is trying to convince consumers that the iPhone won't be used to spy on them is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called “the cloud.” Going down this route would also help protect Apple's profit margins because AI processing through the cloud is far more expensive than when it is run solely on a device. Apple's AI “will be aware of your personal l data without collecting your personal data,” said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering.

                Dolev Klein, pictured at the Cornwall Public Library, developed an AI project to reduce wait times for schizophrenia treatment.                        (Photo : Jason Setnyk photo)
Dolev Klein, a recent graduate of Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School in Cornwall, has developed a groundbreaking AI project aimed at reducing wait times for schizophrenia treatment. This September, Klein will begin his studies at Queen’s University with a prestigious Schulich Leader Award scholarship, and his project could lead to significant advancements in mental health care.
“Over the past few months of researching schizophrenia, I discovered a significant issue in receiving treatment for it. I realized that a specialized professional must conduct a schizophrenic interview for every single patient. This causes severe issues with wait times, so I decided to create a solution,” Klein explained.
Klein’s fascination with computer science and machine learning spurred him to apply these technologies to mental health, a field that has seen limited technological innovation. “I realized that mental health is a field where not many people have tried to innovate with technology. It’s heavily human-focused, but many processes are mechanical and can be automated,” he said.
The project began as an idea for a school science fair last December. Klein’s research revealed that long wait times for schizophrenia treatment were largely due to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) interviews, which are conducted by a limited number of certified professionals. Klein saw an opportunity for standardization through automation. “I found that long wait times for treatment are a major issue in Canada. One of the main causes is a psychiatric interview called the PANSS. I realized that standardization is what computers are built for, so I decided to automate theprocess,” Klein said.
Developing the AI program posed several challenges, including narrowing the focus and implementing the solution. “I spent one day coding for 20 hours straight, which was productive but not recommended,” Klein recounted. His software allows patients to complete the PANSS interview on a computer in about an hour, significantly reducing wait times and operational costs.
Klein discussed his project with a mental health care professional in Cornwall, exploring its potential application to other conditions. “We discussed applying this software to other conditions, such as the admittance interviews done here. These are similar to the PANSS and could be standardized with a computerized system,” he said.
Klein’s achievements were recognized with the Schulich Leader Award, a $120,000 scholarship to study engineering at Queen’s University. He plans to continue his work in AI through Queen’s AI society, QMind, and pursue side projects like this one. “Digital solutions for mental health treatment can significantly reduce wait times. Many companies have tried video interviews with psychiatrists, but there is still a limitednumber of professionals available. The solution is a computerized system that can assist or replace the limited number of certified professionals, addressing the supply-demand issue in mental health services,” Klein emphasized.
Klein’s project demonstrates how innovative technology can address critical issues in mental health care, potentially transforming the way schizophrenia and other conditions are treated in Canada.

Klein’s project demonstrates how innovative technology can address critical issues in mental health care, potentially transforming the way schizophrenia and other conditions are treated in Canada.

Google is rolling out its AI chatbot Bard for teenagers from Thursday after consulting with experts and adolescents in order to create a protected but immersive learning experience for younger users.In a blog post by Tulsee Doshi, Google’s Product Head for Responsible AI, the company showed how teenagers could use Bard to get guidance for writing a speech or even solving maths problems.While 13 is the minimum age for a user to manage their own Google Account, some countries have slightly higher benchmarks. Bard access will be permitted based on these regulations. The AI chatbot has also been trained to recognise and not show unsafe content to children, said the company.

Google will automatically run its ‘double-check’ response feature when Bard is fielding fact-based queries, to avoid hallucination. However, this is not yet a default setting for all Bard users.(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache)Teen users will receive an AI literacy guide as well as a quick on-boarding video to teach them about Bard’s underlying technology and using generative AI tools critically.“For even more interactive learning, we’re bringing a math learning experience into Bard. Anyone, including teens, can simply type or upload a picture of a math equation, and Bard won’t just give the answer — it’ll share step-by-step explanations of how to solve it,” said Doshi in the post. Google provided a video showing how Bard broke down a quadratic equation to its basic operations, as well as a clip where Bard helped a student get started on writing a class speech. The internet giant said it had consulted with safety experts, students, and family organisations before launching Bard for teenagers.

Is OpenAI mishandling your data? The FTC intends to find out
This FTC investigation could potentially change everything for the AI industry – setting precedents for regulation of AI-generated content for years to come.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now turning its all-seeing eye toward OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT. This comes on the heels of reports that our AI friend has been spewing “hallucinations,” or as we like to call it in the real world – lies. 
GPT-3, known for its impressive ability to generate text so human-like that it could be mistaken for the work of a best-selling author, has recently found itself in trouble, reports the Washington Post. 
It seems our AI pal has been caught whispering information that’s about as grounded in reality as a unicorn on a hoverboard. These hallucinations can be anything from slight inaccuracies to full-blown misrepresentations of facts. 
In an age where misinformation spreads faster than wildfire, this raises more red flags than a bullfighting convention.
Hallucinations are just the tip of the iceberg
As if that wasn’t bad enough, the company is being grilled for how it handles its users’ data. According to The Post, The FTC has ordered OpenAI to provide details on the collection of data used to train its language models. 
OpenAI must also explain how it protects personal information from being included in these datasets. 
Violations could result in fines and the implementation of strict data-management practices, similar to what other tech companies have faced in the past.
The timing was inevetible 

Image: KnowTechie
The FTC’s investigation couldn’t have come at a weirder time. With AI technologies becoming as commonplace as smartphones and smart-ass assistants (looking at you, Siri), the accuracy of the information these systems provide is critical.
The FTC getting involved highlights how seriously they’re taking the potential impact of AI on society and shows their commitment to ensuring its responsible use through regulatory oversight.
OpenAI isn’t just sitting around twiddling their thumbs either. They’ve acknowledged GPT-3’s hallucination issue and are actively working on improvements. They’re also pledging transparency and cooperation with the FTC’s investigation – which is always nice to see. 
If Facebook can walk away from an FTC investigation scratch free, this this should be a walk in the park for OpenAI

Image: KnowTechie 
This investigation could potentially change the game for the AI industry – setting precedents for regulation of AI-generated content and laying down future guidelines for accountability and transparency.
As we continue integrating AI technologies into our lives, finding that sweet spot between leveraging their benefits while keeping risks under control is crucial. This investigation serves as an important reminder that achieving this balance still presents challenges.

The FTC intends to find out This FTC investigation could potentially change everything for the AI industry – setting precedents for regulation of AI-generated content for years to come. by Kevin Raposo July 13, 2023 Image: KnowTechie Get $50 from Samsung - Limited Time Offer > The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now turning its all-seeing eye toward OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT. This comes on the heels of reports that our AI friend has been spewing “hallucinations,” or as we like to call it in the real world – lies. GPT-3, known for its impressive ability to generate text so human-like that it could be mistaken for the work of a best-selling author, has recently found itself in trouble, reports the Washington Post. It seems our AI pal has been caught whispering information that’s about as grounded in reality as a unicorn on a hoverboard. These hallucinations can be anything from slight inaccuracies to full-blown misrepresentations of facts. In an age where misinformation spreads faster than wildfire, this raises more red flags than a bullfighting convention. Hallucinations are just the tip of the iceberg As if that wasn’t bad enough, the company is being grilled for how it handles its users’ data. According to The Post, The FTC has ordered OpenAI to provide details on the collection of data used to train its language models. OpenAI must also explain how it protects personal information from being included in these datasets. Violations could result in fines and the implementation of strict data-management practices, similar to what other tech companies have faced in the past. The timing was inevetible Image: KnowTechie The FTC’s investigation couldn’t have come at a weirder time. With AI technologies becoming as commonplace as smartphones and smart-ass assistants (looking at you, Siri), the accuracy of the information these systems provide is critical. The FTC getting involved highlights how seriously they’re taking the potential impact of AI on society and shows their commitment to ensuring its responsible use through regulatory oversight. OpenAI isn’t just sitting around twiddling their thumbs either. They’ve acknowledged GPT-3’s hallucination issue and are actively working on improvements. They’re also pledging transparency and cooperation with the FTC’s investigation – which is always nice to see. If Facebook can walk away from an FTC investigation scratch free, this this should be a walk in the park for OpenAI Image: KnowTechie This investigation could potentially change the game for the AI industry – setting precedents for regulation of AI-generated content and laying down future guidelines for accountability and transparency. As we continue integrating AI technologies into our lives, finding that sweet spot between leveraging their benefits while keeping risks under control is crucial. This investigation serves as an important reminder that achieving this balance still presents challenges. Have any thoughts on this?

Tyler Perry, fearful of AI advances, halts $800 million Atlanta film studio expansion

By Rodney Ho Atlanta </p><p>Journal-Constitution
            
            The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
            

ATLANTA – Tyler Perry has put the kibosh on a planned $800 million expansion at his 330-acre studio in Atlanta over fears that rapid advances in video-related artificial intelligence could reduce demand for traditional filmmaking.
Last week, OpenAI unveiled its new text-to-video model Sora with sample AI-generated videos that impressed and alarmed many observers.
“Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,” Perry said Thursday in an extensive interview with the Hollywood Reporter. He said filmmakers may not need to do location shoots or even build out certain sets if the technology keeps improving.
Perry’s apparent pullback is notable because the prolific filmmaker not only shoots his own projects at Tyler Perry Studios at the former Fort McPherson, one of the largest filming campuses in the country, but he also reaps substantial revenue renting soundstages and backlot operations to other major studios.
In a text through his spokesperson, Perry confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Thursday that his concerns about AI have caused him to hold off on more soundstages and backlot set pieces.
“It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business,” Perry told the Hollywood Reporter. “Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I’m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.”
He said he feels bad he won’t be hiring construction workers for his now nixed expansion “because there is no need to do it.”
Perry told the news outlet he feels the entertainment business has to “galvanize” as “one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry but also in Congress.”
“There’s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us,” he added. “If not, I just don’t see how we survive.”
Though Perry is raising an alarm about the technology, he told the publication he has already used artificial intelligence technology to “age” his own face in two upcoming films instead of going through hours of makeup.
In 2019, Perry opened his current version of Tyler Perry Studios on former Fort McPherson property he purchased in 2015 for $30 million. He created 12 soundstages and a backlot that includes a chapel, a jail, a lakeside cabin, a prison yard, a bank, a diner and a replica of the White House.
He originally planned to add more soundstages in 2022 but told the AJC at the time that held off because of supply-chain issues and the resulting inflation.
Perry and other producers are facing a shifting entertainment world where media companies are spending less across the board on film and TV productions and struggling to make streaming services profitable.
At the same time, investors have spent billions to build more studio square footage in Georgia with several new studios opening the past year: Doraville’s Assembly Studios, Forest Park’s BlueStar Studios, Douglasville’s Lionsgate Studios, Athens’ Athena Studios and Atlanta’s Electric Owl Studios. Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Eagle Rock Studios in Norcross, EUE Screen Gems in Atlanta and Three Ring Studios in Covington have also expanded in recent years.
Georgia now has more soundstage space than New York and has the second most space in the United States only behind California.
The boom in TV and film production in the state stems from generous tax credits to production companies passed by the state in 2008. A state House bill that is currently being considered would make the tax credit system more complicated and potentially less enticing to everyone from independent filmmakers to Disney and Netflix.
Perry has also talked publicly about creating a public-facing entertainment district on 28 acres adjoining Tyler Perry Studios, featuring retail, restaurants, a theater and a museum. But he has never announced a specific date to begin construction and it remains a future project.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the tourism industry by empowering professionals to drive growth and improve customer experience. AI tools enable tourism management professionals to streamline operations, make data-driven decisions, and provide personalized services.
AI’s impact can be seen in the area of data analysis. With vast amounts of data generated from online bookings, social media, and customer feedback, AI-powered analytics tools can quickly and accurately process this information. These insights help professionals identify trends, understand customer behavior, and predict future demand, facilitating effective planning and strategizing.
Customer service is also being enhanced through AI. Chatbots powered by AI are being utilized to handle customer inquiries and complaints, delivering instant responses and reducing the workload for customer service representatives. AI can analyze customer feedback to identify areas for improvement, enabling professionals to enhance services and meet customer expectations.
Personalization is another significant area impacted by AI. By analyzing customer data, AI algorithms can understand preferences and behaviors to provide tailored recommendations and offers. This enhances the customer experience and fosters loyalty, as AI suggests activities or destinations based on a customer’s travel history or preferences.
AI aids in optimizing marketing efforts by analyzing data from multiple sources. Professionals can identify the most effective marketing channels and strategies, reaching the right audience at the right time with the right message. This improves campaign effectiveness and return on investment.
Efficient resource management is another advantage of AI in tourism. AI-powered tools predict demand and assist in resource allocation, ensuring optimal utilization and reducing wastage. This improves operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
In conclusion, AI empowers tourism management professionals by providing valuable insights, enhancing customer service, enabling personalization, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving resource management. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on the tourism industry is expected to grow, offering even more opportunities for professionals to drive growth and success. Embracing AI is crucial for the future of the tourism industry, promising significant benefits for those who harness its capabilities.

                  Zoom’s Terms of Service Spark Concerns about AI Training on User Data

An update to Zoom’s terms of service has caused alarm among social media users, who claim that the videoconferencing company is using their online doctor visits and virtual happy hours to train artificial intelligence models. However, Zoom quickly responded by clarifying its policy in a blog post, stating that it will not use audio, video, or chat customer content to train AI models without the user’s consent.
The current terms do allow Zoom to train AI on other data, such as user behavior, without additional permission. While the terms now assure users that their customer content will not be used for AI training without consent, it may be difficult for meeting participants to opt out if their host decides otherwise.
Zoom added language to its terms in March that distinguishes between “service-generated data” and “customer content.” Service-generated data can be used for machine learning or AI training, while customer content may also be used for these purposes. However, Zoom clarified that this refers to new generative AI features that users must agree to, and separate consent is required to share this data with the company.
Experts initially believed that Zoom’s terms allowed them to use customer content for AI training without additional consent. But Zoom added explicit language to the terms, stating that they will not use customer content to train AI models without consent.
However, concerns remain about the way this function works, particularly for participants in Zoom calls. If a meeting host decides to use the meeting summary feature, participants are informed that an AI feature has been enabled and asked to either proceed with the meeting or leave. Some experts question whether this offers real consent, as participants may not be able to opt out of a meeting or stop using Zoom if their employer requires it.
Overall, Zoom has addressed the concerns raised by the updated terms, but there are still questions about consent and participant control over data usage.

News'I caught my husband cheating with an AI chatbot, it's ruined my life'The woman says it doesn't matter that the 'person' he was flirting with isn't realnottinghampostBookmarkShareNewsByNeil ShawNetwork Content Editor (Live and Trends)13:43, 9 NOV 2023Updated13:55, 9 NOV 2023Bookmark A user on the Illicitencounters.com flirt forum has sparked an online debate after she revealed she caught her husband cheating with a virtual AI artificial lover. A flood of user messages followed, throwing up some intriguing opinions on AI and cheating. Experts have warned that some people will see chatting to a 'pretend' lover online as much cheating as if you were flirting with someone real.  The woman posted: “Who is reading about this AI thing in the news? It's already ruined my life. I caught my husband with a bloody virtual lover. YES THEY DO EXIST!!!!! ""I'm still livid and feel so hurt. I chucked him out immediately, I don't care if it's real or not the intention to cheat was there. Makes me feel sick. Anyone else know anyone that's been through the same thing? I can't decide whether it is over for good or not. helppp!” Users were quick to offer their opinions. One wrote: “Pretty soon AI fakes will have us all questioning what is real or not online and in the news, at least in a way that we've never before. One upside is that it could lead to a society ditching online mediums of returning back to in-person interactions more. So a return to old-school affair finding?"" Another added: “I agree that AI is here to stay, whatever us mere mortals think of it. I would still argue/hope that I can offer things a bot would struggle with. I would also argue that 'escalated expectations' very much applies to men too! For example, the amount of guys around my age on here who have a preferred age range starting at 21 baffles me.” A third said: “There’s loads of chat in the Mansphere about AI replacing women.... A lot of men are tapping out of trying to find a woman as online dating has escalated female expectations way out of the stratosphere...Most [women] set [the height filter on dating apps] to 186cm +. Given only a minority of available men are 6ft + , that shows how difficult it is for many men to even get noticed. AI fantasy sex chat will be a vast market going forward. Some dudes are already paying a dollar a day for access.” Another replied: “As much as I agree with your logical way of thinking and couples don’t seem to talk ( guilty as charged) and can’t seem to get feel ‘heard ‘ in their relationship. I also see partners that think they are entitled to experience everything whether it be right or wrong because there is a licence to do it ..why not ???? There has to be a code of conduct or we are just going to follow each other into hell .. The fact that you can have virtual sex might be a good thing but these platforms are addictive and like porn they are designed to keep you interested and therefore give you a high that most people cannot achieve in normal’ relationships…aka it’s all fake.” One said: “Yes, this AI is causing a real problem! Too many men happy to indulge in online porn and virtual encounters! Rather than live in the real world and enjoy real-world enjoyment...Turn a blind eye if you got a good lifestyle, he's not going to leave you!” Another added: “Earlier this year, the Replika app (friendship chatbot) turned off the ability to have virtual sex with a bot and the users loudly complained - it seems that is what most of the users wanted from their bot. We will increasingly see it as normal that an AI can interact naturally and replicate a fantasy lover - but it is still chat. It's not a real person or a real affair. Either sit down and find out what he gets from the bot that he cannot get from swapping messages with you or get your own bot...”  Jessica Leoni, Sex & Relationships expert at Illicitencounters.com, said: ""Technology is playing an increasingly complex role in our relationships, and the blurred lines between virtual and real-world connections can lead to unexpected challenges. The human emotional experience remains at the core of any relationship, and as artificial intelligence evolves, it's crucial for couples to maintain open communication, trust, and boundaries.  ""Our most recent poll on AI and relationships revealed 64% of members believe relationships with AI bots ""should"" be considered cheating - which we believe is driven by the explosion of new apps and platforms to facilitate a virtual relationship.""Story SavedYou can find this story in  My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow NottinghamshireLiveFacebookTwitterMore Ontendendo

A New Era of Iceberg Mapping: How Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizes Antarctic Research
  ByRaibeart Anndra

Sam 15, 2023
  Researchers from the University of Leeds have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of Antarctic research. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), they have developed a neural network capable of accurately mapping the vast expanse of icebergs in satellite images with astonishing speed, completing the task in just 0.01 seconds. This significant breakthrough brings unprecedented efficiency and accuracy to the study of large icebergs in the Antarctic environment.Large icebergs play a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem, impacting various aspects such as ocean physics, chemistry, biology, and maritime operations. Locating and monitoring icebergs is essential in understanding the amount of meltwater they contribute to the ocean. Dr. Anne Braakmann-Folgmann, the lead author of the study, emphasizes the importance of this research in shedding light on the significance of these colossal ice formations.Traditionally, identifying icebergs from satellite images had its challenges. Overcoming visual obstacles such as distinguishing icebergs from sea ice, coastlines, and wind-roughened oceans proved to be difficult. Dr. Braakmann-Folgmann elaborates on these hurdles, highlighting the struggle to differentiate the main iceberg from smaller fragments that frequently break off its edges. Moreover, the coastlines often posed a similar appearance to icebergs in satellite imagery, resulting in segmentation errors.To address these limitations, the researchers employed a neural network architecture based on the U-net design. The algorithm was meticulously trained using Sentinel-1 images featuring giant icebergs in various environmental conditions. Manual outlines served as the target for this training process, ensuring accurate mapping of iceberg extents.The effectiveness of this innovative approach was tested with a diverse dataset comprising seven icebergs of varying sizes, ranging from 54 square kilometers to 1052 square kilometers. The dataset incorporated between 15 and 46 images per iceberg, spanning multiple seasons from 2014 to 2020. The neural network successfully overcame the challenges posed by complex environmental conditions, allowing for precise iceberg mapping even in the most demanding scenarios.This groundbreaking development in Antarctic research paves the way for future advancements in understanding the crucial role of icebergs in the overall Antarctic ecosystem. By combining the power of AI with satellite imagery, researchers can now efficiently analyze and monitor icebergs, enabling a deeper understanding of their impact on our planet.CÀBHAQ: How does the neural network map icebergs in satellite images?A: The neural network utilizes a U-net design and is trained using Sentinel-1 images featuring large icebergs. Manual outlines are used as the target for accurate mapping.Q: What challenges did researchers face in identifying icebergs from satellite images?A: Researchers encountered difficulties in distinguishing icebergs from sea ice, coastlines, and wind-roughened oceans. Additionally, smaller iceberg fragments and the resemblance of the Antarctic coastline to icebergs posed further obstacles.Q: What is the significance of mapping iceberg extents?A: Mapping iceberg extents allows researchers to quantify the amount of meltwater released by icebergs into the ocean, enabling a greater understanding of their impact on ocean physics, chemistry, biology, and maritime operations.

(The issue is particularly striking because the white Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, is Asian.)It's yet another sign that the data tools that Meta's Imagine, and competing systems like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's DALL-E, are trained on are inherently flawed and suffering from some glaring biases. After all, scouring the entirety of the internet to train an image generator is bound to further existing racial stereotypes — and the company's efforts to correct them are falling far short.Artificial DiversityWe've already seen the pendulum swing way too far in the other direction.

 India to Lead the AI Revolution, Says Piyush Goyal at Mumbai Tech Week 2025
						


Mumbai: Piyush Goyal, India’s Commerce and Industry Minister, has expressed confidence that India will be at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, thanks to the country’s supportive policies and infrastructure. Speaking at the Mumbai Tech Week 2025, Goyal highlighted India’s significant strides in the AI space and emphasized Mumbai’s potential to become the tech hub of the nation.

India Positioned for Leadership in AI Innovation
Minister Piyush Goyal praised the Modi government’s policies, which he believes are enabling entrepreneurs and innovators to fully capitalize on the digital wave brought about by AI. “India is well-positioned to lead the AI era,” he said, stressing that the government’s efforts are ensuring that the country remains at the forefront of technological advancements. 
Goyal also pointed out Mumbai’s potential to become India’s tech hub, citing the city’s substantial investments in infrastructure, capital, and skills that will help it emerge as a key player in the global tech ecosystem. He was confident that Mumbai’s strong foundation will attract innovation and drive further AI adoption in India.
AI Adoption in India: A Growing Phenomenon
India’s AI adoption is already on the rise, with the country recording an impressive three billion AI-related app downloads in 2024—surpassing both the United States (1.5 billion) and China (1.3 billion). This remarkable achievement has earned India recognition as the “use case capital of AI,” according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. India’s active implementation of AI technologies, rather than just research or theoretical development, is a significant factor in its rapid growth.
Ethical AI and Global Collaboration
India’s leadership in AI isn’t just about technological advancements but also ensuring ethical AI usage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has frequently emphasized that AI is not only a national issue but a global responsibility. During the AI Action Summit in Paris, which India co-chaired with France, he stressed the importance of making AI ethical, inclusive, and trustworthy.

The Prime Minister also addressed the need for global cooperation in creating AI governance, focusing on promoting innovation while managing risks. Modi called for democratizing technology, especially for the Global South, to ensure the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are achieved.
India’s Digital Public Infrastructure and AI Mission
Highlighting India’s success in building a Digital Public Infrastructure, Prime Minister Modi referred to the country’s efforts to build AI that is accessible to everyone, especially through the creation of India’s own Large Language Model for AI. This initiative underscores the country’s commitment to ensuring AI benefits reach all of its citizens.
In the same address, PM Modi announced that India would be hosting the next AI Summit, further cementing its role as a global leader in AI technology.
With its proactive policies, growing AI adoption, and commitment to ethical practices, India is set to lead the charge in the AI era. As Piyush Goyal stated, India’s leadership in AI is just the beginning, and the country’s advancements will play a key role in shaping the future of global technology.

We are well aware of the long wait times to get into the GP and routine follow-up care. Having AI-enabled assistants will help triage these and provide necessary support for those waiting. A system optimised by AI which sees the sickest first, for whom intervention is still possible, is more time and cost efficient.”In some parts of the NHS, AI is currently being used to analyse images, such as mammograms, and support radiologists in making decisions. However, Dr Dubis said AI does have “several limitations”.He added: “The biggest issue is that AI technology learns from what it has previously seen. We frequently read about the hundreds of thousands or low millions of health records being aggregated to develop some of these AI tools. However, when we compare these numbers to the tens of billions of images available for AI tools like self-driving cars, we see the problem.“The errors in self-driving cars make international news, so we know that even with all that data, these tools are not perfect. Given the regulations around data sharing, it is very difficult to aggregate enough data to learn all parameters of humanity and disease. We need to continually work together to understand the power of AI and how it can improve healthcare efficiency and quality, and work to aggregate the data needed to become better.”  READ MORE    Healthy mum's 'devastating' MND diagnosis that left her in 'tears for years'  [LATEST] AI-enabled asssitants could help triage patients (Image: Getty)The Government recently committed £21 million to rolling out AI more widely on the NHS, with trusts invited to apply for a portion of the funding.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the technology could help cut NHS waiting lists ahead of winter. On Tuesday, Dr Raj Jena, an oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said AI could be used to treat more cancers. He led a research team which found that a system he helped design was freeing up radiologists’ time.   Dr Jena created Osairis using a £500,000 grant from NHS AI Lab and it is currently being used in the head and neck and prostate cancer departments at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. The system helps doctors draw around healthy organs prior to a patient being given radiotherapy. The crucial step ensures healthy tissue is protected.Dr Jena now hopes the technology can be used for the likes of breast and lung cancer, as well as brain tumours.

More info Trending   And, in June, NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said more uses for AI in the NHS were “on the horizon”. However, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting argued that the technology is not being deployed fast enough. Dr Dubis said the rollout of AI in the NHS should “balance safety with efficiency”.He added: “I agree that we need to move faster, but this needs to be done in a safe way. Any traditional drug or tool that is implemented into a clinical workflow needs to go through extensive clinical trials to show safety and efficacy, and to provide a rationale for why it works. We need to apply the same standards to any AI tools which are responsible for patient care. Above all, we need to address safety and explain the ability to move forward.”The debate around how AI should be regulated going forward is ongoing and Dr Dubis called for people to be educated about the technology and its potential. He said: “We need to work on both the development, but also the education. For years, futurists have said that people’s jobs will be replaced within a few years, yet the mass layoffs have not come. There are technological reasons for this, but also human factors. Some jobs, like medicine, need to be done by an emotional and engaged entity.“We are a long way removed from providing these sorts of assets to a computer. These trade-offs will provide some push-back and place a check on advancement. As long as the same levels of scrutiny are applied to AI as any other clinical tool, the progress will be safe going forward. It was not long ago that medicinal chemistry made rapid advances in new therapeutic methods.“At that time there was the fear over what these substances would do. In the meantime, there were some failures, but there were also great advancements in health and life expectancy. AI will have the same life course as medicinal chemistry. Growth will be regulated by checks and balances both from official channels such as regulatory bodies and human factors – the needs and desires of the people.” Related articles    Only 6% of people agree with Government definition of a ‘new’ hospital – poll    Now consultants to join junior doctors and launch two-day strike action    Tech-loving entrepreneur says AI does more work in half the time    Ministers buy 1,000 more defibrillators to aid communities    Families of 456 people who died in 'biggest NHS scandal ever' want inquest   NHS Artificial Intelligence      Most read in Tech          Google bans 5 popular Android apps - all UK phone owners must delete them now         I drove an alternative to electric cars and it has one massive advantage over EVs         Apple MacBook Air 15-inch review: Bigger screen is an absolute dream         A better 5G network could boost UK economy by up to £5bn a year, experts predict         Delete this popular Windows 10 game or your web history and passwords will be exposed             Check your Freeview TV now!

Google Research and Google’s AI research lab, DeepMind, have detailed the impressive reach of Med-Gemini, a family of advanced AI models specialized in medicine. It's a huge advancement in clinical diagnostics with massive real-world potential.
Doctors treat a multitude of patients daily, with needs ranging from simple to very complex. To deliver effective care, they must be familiar with each patient’s health record and keep up-to-date with the newest procedures and treatments. And then there’s the all-important doctor-patient relationship, built on empathy, trust, and communication. For an AI to come close to emulating a real-world doctor, it needs to be able to do all of these things.The intersection of AI and medicine has really taken off. In the last six months, New Atlas has reported on AI models that aid less experienced doctors in identifying the precursors of colon cancer, diagnose childhood autism from eye images, and predict in real-time whether a surgeon has removed all cancerous tissue during breast cancer surgery. But Med-Gemini is something else.Google’s Gemini models are a new generation of multimodal AI models, meaning that they can process information from different modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio. The models are adept at language and conversation, understanding the diverse information they’re trained on, and what’s called ‘long-context reasoning,’ or reasoning from large amounts of data such as hours of video or tens of hours of audio.Med-Gemini has all of the advantages of the foundational Gemini models but has fine-tuned them. The researchers tested these medicine-focused tweaks and included their results in the paper. There’s a lot in the 58-page paper; we’ve selected the most impressive bits.Self-training and web search capabilitiesArriving at a diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan requires doctors to combine their own medical knowledge with a raft of other relevant information: patient symptoms, medical, surgical and social history, lab results and the results of other investigative tests, and the patient’s response to prior treatment. Treatments are a ‘movable feast,’ with existing ones being updated and new ones being introduced. All these things influence a doctor’s clinical reasoning.That’s why, with Med-Gemini, Google included access to web-based searching to enable more advanced clinical reasoning. Like many medicine-focused large language models (LLMs), Med-Gemini was trained on MedQA, multiple-choice questions representative of US Medical License Exam (USMLE) questions designed to test medical knowledge and reasoning across diverse scenarios.
How the self-training and web search tools work in Med-GeminiSaab et al.


However, Google also developed two novel datasets for their model. The first, MedQA-R (Reasoning), extends MedQA with synthetically generated reasoning explanations called ‘Chain-of-Thoughts’ (CoTs). The second, MedQA-RS (Reasoning and Search), provides the model with instructions to use web search results as additional context to improve answer accuracy. If a medical question leads to an uncertain answer, the model is prompted to undertake a web search to obtain further information to resolve the uncertainty.Med-Gemini was tested on 14 medical benchmarks and established a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10, surpassing the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a comparison could be made. On the MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy using its uncertainty-guided search strategy, outperforming Google’s previous medical LLM, Med-PaLM 2, by 4.5%.On seven multimodal benchmarks, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) image challenge (images of challenging clinical cases from which a diagnosis is made from a list of 10), Med-Gemini performed better than GPT-4 by an average relative margin of 44.5%.“While the results … are promising, significant further research is needed,” the researchers said. “For example, we haven’t considered restricting the search results to more authoritative medical sources, using multimodal search retrieval or performed analysis on accuracy and relevance of search results and the quality of the citations. Further, it remains to be seen if smaller LLMs can also be taught to make use of web search. We leave these explorations to future work.”Retrieving specific information from lengthy electronic health recordsElectronic health records (EHRs) can be long, but doctors need to be aware of what they contain. To complicate matters, they typically contain textual similarities (“diabetes mellitus” vs. “diabetic nephropathy”), misspellings, acronyms (“Rx” vs. “prescription”), and synonyms (“cerebrovascular accident” vs. “stroke”) – things that can pose a challenge to AI.To test Med-Gemini’s ability to understand and reason from long-context medical information, the researchers ran a so-called ‘needle-in-a-haystack task’ using a large, publicly available database, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care or MIMIC-III, containing de-identified health data of patients admitted to intensive care.The goal was for the model to retrieve the relevant mention of a rare and subtle medical condition, symptom, or procedure (the ‘needle’) over a large collection of clinical notes in the EHR (‘the haystack).Two hundred examples were curated, and each example consisted of a collection of de-identified EHR notes from 44 ICU patients with long medical histories. They had to have the following criteria:More than 100 medical notes, with the length of each example ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 wordsIn each example, the condition was only mentioned onceEach sample had a single condition of interestThere were two steps to the needle-in-a-haystack task. First, Med-Gemini had to retrieve all mentions of the specified medical problem from the extensive records. Second, the model had to evaluate the relevance of all mentions, categorize them, and conclude whether the patient had a history of that problem, providing clear reasoning for its decision.
Example of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilitiesSaab et al.


Compared to the SoTA method, Med-Gemini performed well on the needle-in-a-haystack task. It rated 0.77 on precision compared to the SoTA method (0.85) and outdid the SoTA method on recall: 0.76 vs. 0.73.“Perhaps the most notable aspect of Med-Gemini is the long-context processing capabilities because they open up new performance frontiers and novel, previously infeasible application possibilities for medical AI systems,” said the researchers. “This ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ retrieval task reflects a real-world challenge faced by clinicians and Med-Gemini-M 1.5’s performance demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce cognitive load and augment clinicians’ capabilities by efficiently extracting and analyzing information from vast amounts of patient data.”For an easy-to-understand discussion of these key research points, and an update on the mud-slinging between Google and Microsoft, check out AI Explained’s video from 13:38 onwards.

Conversations with Med-GeminiIn a test of real-world usefulness, Med-Gemini was asked about an itchy skin lump by a patient user. After asking for an image, the model asked appropriate follow-up questions and correctly diagnosed the rare lesion, recommending what the user should do next.
Example of Med-Gemini's diagnostic dialogue in a dermatological settingSaab et al.


Med-Gemini was also asked to interpret a chest X-ray for a physician while they were waiting for a formal radiologist’s report and formulate a plain English version of the report that could be provided to the patient.
Med-Gemini's diagnostic dialogue assistance in a radiological settingSaab et al.


“The multimodal conversation capabilities of Med-Gemini-M 1.5 are promising given they are attained without any specific medical dialogue fine-tuning,” the researchers said. “Such capabilities allow for seamless and natural interactions between people, clinicians, and AI systems.”However, the researchers recognize that further work is needed.“This capability has significant potential for helpful real-world applications, including assisting clinicians and patients, but of course also entails highly significant risks,” they said. “While highlighting the potential for future research in this domain, we have not rigorously benchmarked capabilities for clinical conversation in this work as previously explored by others in dedicated research towards conversational diagnostic AI.”Visions of the futureWhere to from here? The researchers admit that there is much more work to be done, but the Med-Gemini model's initial capabilities are certainly promising. Importantly, they plan to incorporate responsible AI principles, including privacy and fairness, throughout the model development process.“Privacy considerations in particular need to be rooted in existing healthcare policies and regulations governing and safeguarding patient information,” the researchers said. “Fairness is another area that may require attention, as there is a risk that AI systems in healthcare may unintentionally reflect or amplify historical biases and inequities, potentially leading to disparate model performance and harmful outcomes for marginalized groups.”But, ultimately, Med-Gemini is seen as a tool for good.“Large multimodal language models are ushering in a new era of possibilities for health and medicine,” the researchers said. “The capabilities demonstrated by Gemini and Med-Gemini suggest a significant leap forward in the depth and breadth of opportunities to accelerate biomedical discoveries and assist in healthcare delivery and experiences. However, it is paramount that advancements in model capabilities are accompanied by meticulous attention to the reliability and safety of these systems. By prioritizing both aspects, we can responsibly envision a future where the capabilities of AI systems are meaningful and safe accelerators of both scientific progress and care in medicine.”The study can be accessed via the pre-print website arXiv.

View gallery - 5 images Google Research and Google’s AI research lab, DeepMind, have detailed the impressive reach of Med-Gemini, a family of advanced AI models specialized in medicine. It's a huge advancement in clinical diagnostics with massive real-world potential. Doctors treat a multitude of patients daily, with needs ranging from simple to very complex. To deliver effective care, they must be familiar with each patient’s health record and keep up-to-date with the newest procedures and treatments. And then there’s the all-important doctor-patient relationship, built on empathy, trust, and communication. For an AI to come close to emulating a real-world doctor, it needs to be able to do all of these things.The intersection of AI and medicine has really taken off. In the last six months, New Atlas has reported on AI models that aid less experienced doctors in identifying the precursors of colon cancer, diagnose childhood autism from eye images, and predict in real-time whether a surgeon has removed all cancerous tissue during breast cancer surgery. But Med-Gemini is something else.Google’s Gemini models are a new generation of multimodal AI models, meaning that they can process information from different modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio. The models are adept at language and conversation, understanding the diverse information they’re trained on, and what’s called ‘long-context reasoning,’ or reasoning from large amounts of data such as hours of video or tens of hours of audio.Med-Gemini has all of the advantages of the foundational Gemini models but has fine-tuned them. The researchers tested these medicine-focused tweaks and included their results in the paper. There’s a lot in the 58-page paper; we’ve selected the most impressive bits.Self-training and web search capabilitiesArriving at a diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan requires doctors to combine their own medical knowledge with a raft of other relevant information: patient symptoms, medical, surgical and social history, lab results and the results of other investigative tests, and the patient’s response to prior treatment. Treatments are a ‘movable feast,’ with existing ones being updated and new ones being introduced. All these things influence a doctor’s clinical reasoning.That’s why, with Med-Gemini, Google included access to web-based searching to enable more advanced clinical reasoning. Like many medicine-focused large language models (LLMs), Med-Gemini was trained on MedQA, multiple-choice questions representative of US Medical License Exam (USMLE) questions designed to test medical knowledge and reasoning across diverse scenarios. How the self-training and web search tools work in Med-GeminiSaab et al. However, Google also developed two novel datasets for their model. The first, MedQA-R (Reasoning), extends MedQA with synthetically generated reasoning explanations called ‘Chain-of-Thoughts’ (CoTs). The second, MedQA-RS (Reasoning and Search), provides the model with instructions to use web search results as additional context to improve answer accuracy. If a medical question leads to an uncertain answer, the model is prompted to undertake a web search to obtain further information to resolve the uncertainty.Med-Gemini was tested on 14 medical benchmarks and established a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10, surpassing the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a comparison could be made. On the MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy using its uncertainty-guided search strategy, outperforming Google’s previous medical LLM, Med-PaLM 2, by 4.5%.On seven multimodal benchmarks, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) image challenge (images of challenging clinical cases from which a diagnosis is made from a list of 10), Med-Gemini performed better than GPT-4 by an average relative margin of 44.5%.“While the results … are promising, significant further research is needed,” the researchers said. “For example, we haven’t considered restricting the search results to more authoritative medical sources, using multimodal search retrieval or performed analysis on accuracy and relevance of search results and the quality of the citations. Further, it remains to be seen if smaller LLMs can also be taught to make use of web search. We leave these explorations to future work.”Retrieving specific information from lengthy electronic health recordsElectronic health records (EHRs) can be long, but doctors need to be aware of what they contain. To complicate matters, they typically contain textual similarities (“diabetes mellitus” vs. “diabetic nephropathy”), misspellings, acronyms (“Rx” vs. “prescription”), and synonyms (“cerebrovascular accident” vs. “stroke”) – things that can pose a challenge to AI.To test Med-Gemini’s ability to understand and reason from long-context medical information, the researchers ran a so-called ‘needle-in-a-haystack task’ using a large, publicly available database, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care or MIMIC-III, containing de-identified health data of patients admitted to intensive care.The goal was for the model to retrieve the relevant mention of a rare and subtle medical condition, symptom, or procedure (the ‘needle’) over a large collection of clinical notes in the EHR (‘the haystack).Two hundred examples were curated, and each example consisted of a collection of de-identified EHR notes from 44 ICU patients with long medical histories. They had to have the following criteria:More than 100 medical notes, with the length of each example ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 wordsIn each example, the condition was only mentioned onceEach sample had a single condition of interestThere were two steps to the needle-in-a-haystack task. First, Med-Gemini had to retrieve all mentions of the specified medical problem from the extensive records. Second, the model had to evaluate the relevance of all mentions, categorize them, and conclude whether the patient had a history of that problem, providing clear reasoning for its decision. Example of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilitiesSaab et al. Compared to the SoTA method, Med-Gemini performed well on the needle-in-a-haystack task. It rated 0.77 on precision compared to the SoTA method (0.85) and outdid the SoTA method on recall: 0.76 vs. 0.73.“Perhaps the most notable aspect of Med-Gemini is the long-context processing capabilities because they open up new performance frontiers and novel, previously infeasible application possibilities for medical AI systems,” said the researchers. “This ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ retrieval task reflects a real-world challenge faced by clinicians and Med-Gemini-M 1.5’s performance demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce cognitive load and augment clinicians’ capabilities by efficiently extracting and analyzing information from vast amounts of patient data.”For an easy-to-understand discussion of these key research points, and an update on the mud-slinging between Google and Microsoft, check out AI Explained’s video from 13:38 onwards. New OpenAI Model 'Imminent' and AI Stakes Get Raised (plus Med Gemini, GPT 2 Chatbot and Scale AI) Conversations with Med-GeminiIn a test of real-world usefulness, Med-Gemini was asked about an itchy skin lump by a patient user. After asking for an image, the model asked appropriate follow-up questions and correctly diagnosed the rare lesion, recommending what the user should do next. Example of Med-Gemini's diagnostic dialogue in a dermatological settingSaab et al. Med-Gemini was also asked to interpret a chest X-ray for a physician while they were waiting for a formal radiologist’s report and formulate a plain English version of the report that could be provided to the patient. Med-Gemini's diagnostic dialogue assistance in a radiological settingSaab et al. “The multimodal conversation capabilities of Med-Gemini-M 1.5 are promising given they are attained without any specific medical dialogue fine-tuning,” the researchers said. “Such capabilities allow for seamless and natural interactions between people, clinicians, and AI systems.”However, the researchers recognize that further work is needed.“This capability has significant potential for helpful real-world applications, including assisting clinicians and patients, but of course also entails highly significant risks,” they said. “While highlighting the potential for future research in this domain, we have not rigorously benchmarked capabilities for clinical conversation in this work as previously explored by others in dedicated research towards conversational diagnostic AI.”Visions of the futureWhere to from here? The researchers admit that there is much more work to be done, but the Med-Gemini model's initial capabilities are certainly promising. Importantly, they plan to incorporate responsible AI principles, including privacy and fairness, throughout the model development process.“Privacy considerations in particular need to be rooted in existing healthcare policies and regulations governing and safeguarding patient information,” the researchers said. “Fairness is another area that may require attention, as there is a risk that AI systems in healthcare may unintentionally reflect or amplify historical biases and inequities, potentially leading to disparate model performance and harmful outcomes for marginalized groups.”But, ultimately, Med-Gemini is seen as a tool for good.“Large multimodal language models are ushering in a new era of possibilities for health and medicine,” the researchers said. “The capabilities demonstrated by Gemini and Med-Gemini suggest a significant leap forward in the depth and breadth of opportunities to accelerate biomedical discoveries and assist in healthcare delivery and experiences. However, it is paramount that advancements in model capabilities are accompanied by meticulous attention to the reliability and safety of these systems. By prioritizing both aspects, we can responsibly envision a future where the capabilities of AI systems are meaningful and safe accelerators of both scientific progress and care in medicine.”The study can be accessed via the pre-print website arXiv.

Most previous chemistry Nobel Prizes have gone to researchers in academia. Many laureates went on to form startup companies to further expand and commercialize their groundbreaking work – for instance, CRISPR gene-editing technology and quantum dots– but the research, from start to end, wasn’t done in the commercial sphere.Although the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry are awarded separately, there is a fascinating connection between the winning research in those fields in 2024. The physics award went to two computer scientists who laid the foundations for machine learning, while the chemistry laureates were rewarded for their use of machine learning to tackle one of biology’s biggest mysteries: how proteins fold.The 2024 Nobel Prizes underscore both the importance of this kind of artificial intelligence and how science today often crosses traditional boundaries, blending different fields to achieve groundbreaking results.The Challenge of Protein FoldingProteins are the molecular machines of life. They make up a significant portion of our bodies, including muscles, enzymes, hormones, blood, hair and cartilage.Proteins are chains of amino acid molecules that form a 3D shape based on their atoms’ interactions. ©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of SciencesUnderstanding proteins’ structures is essential because their shapes determine their functions. Back in 1972, Christian Anfinsen won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for showing that the sequence of a protein’s amino acid building blocks dictates the protein’s shape, which, in turn, influences its function. If a protein folds incorrectly, it may not work properly and could lead to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cystic fibrosis or diabetes.A protein’s overall shape depends on the tiny interactions, the attractions and repulsions, between all the atoms in the amino acids its made of. Some want to be together, some don’t. The protein twists and folds itself into a final shape based on many thousands of these chemical interactions.For decades, one of biology’s greatest challenges was predicting a protein’s shape based solely on its amino acid sequence. Although researchers can now predict the shape, we still don’t understand how the proteins maneuver into their specific shapes and minimize the repulsions of all the interatomic interactions in a few microseconds.To understand how proteins work and to prevent misfolding, scientists needed a way to predict the way proteins fold, but solving this puzzle was no easy task.In 2003, University of Washington biochemist David Baker wrote Rosetta, a computer program for designing proteins. With it, he showed it was possible to reverse the protein-folding problem by designing a protein shape and then predicting the amino acid sequence needed to create it.It was a phenomenal jump forward, but the shape chosen for the calculation was simple, and the calculations were complex. A major paradigm shift was required to routinely design novel proteins with desired structures.A New Era of Machine LearningMachine learning is a type of AI where computers learn to solve problems by analyzing vast amounts of data. It’s been used in various fields, from game-playing and speech recognition to autonomous vehicles and scientific research. The idea behind machine learning is to use hidden patterns in data to answer complex questions.This approach made a huge leap in 2010 when Demis Hassabis co-founded DeepMind, a company aiming to combine neuroscience with AI to solve real-world problems.Hassabis, a chess prodigy at age 4, quickly made headlines with AlphaZero, an AI that taught itself to play chess at a superhuman level. In 2017, AlphaZero thoroughly beat the world’s top computer chess program, Stockfish-8. The AI’s ability to learn from its own gameplay, rather than relying on preprogrammed strategies, marked a turning point in the AI world.Soon after, DeepMind applied similar techniques to Go, an ancient board game known for its immense complexity. In 2016, its AI program AlphaGodefeated one of the world’s top players, Lee Sedol, in a widely watched match that stunned millions.Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind on Oct. 9, 2024, after being awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. AP Photo/Alastair GrantIn 2016, Hassabis shifted DeepMind’s focus to a new challenge: the protein-folding problem. Under the leadership of John Jumper, a chemist with a background in protein science, the AlphaFold project began. The team used a large database of experimentally determined protein structures to train the AI, which allowed it to learn the principles of protein folding. The result was AlphaFold2, an AI that could predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences with remarkable accuracy.This was a significant scientific breakthrough. AlphaFold has since predicted the structures of over 200 million proteins – essentially all the proteins that scientists have sequenced to date. This massive database of protein structures are now freely available, accelerating research in biology, medicine, and drug development.Designer Proteins to Fight DiseaseUnderstanding how proteins fold and function is crucial for designing new drugs. Enzymes, a type of protein, act as catalysts in biochemical reactions and can speed up or regulate these processes. To treat diseases such as cancer or diabetes, researchers often target specific enzymes involved in disease pathways. By predicting the shape of a protein, scientists can figure out where small molecules – potential drug candidates – might bind to it, which is the first step in designing new medicines.In 2024, DeepMind launched AlphaFold3, an upgraded version of the AlphaFold program that not only predicts protein shapes but also identifies potential binding sites for small molecules. This advance makes it easier for researchers to design drugs that precisely target the right proteins.Google bought Deepmind for reportedly around half a billion dollars in 2014.

Most previous chemistry Nobel Prizes have gone to researchers in academia. Many laureates went on to form startup companies to further expand and commercialize their groundbreaking work – for instance, CRISPR gene-editing technology and quantum dots– but the research, from start to end, wasn’t done in the commercial sphere.Although the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry are awarded separately, there is a fascinating connection between the winning research in those fields in 2024. The physics award went to two computer scientists who laid the foundations for machine learning, while the chemistry laureates were rewarded for their use of machine learning to tackle one of biology’s biggest mysteries: how proteins fold.The 2024 Nobel Prizes underscore both the importance of this kind of artificial intelligence and how science today often crosses traditional boundaries, blending different fields to achieve groundbreaking results.The Challenge of Protein FoldingProteins are the molecular machines of life. They make up a significant portion of our bodies, including muscles, enzymes, hormones, blood, hair and cartilage.Proteins are chains of amino acid molecules that form a 3D shape based on their atoms’ interactions. ©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of SciencesUnderstanding proteins’ structures is essential because their shapes determine their functions. Back in 1972, Christian Anfinsen won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for showing that the sequence of a protein’s amino acid building blocks dictates the protein’s shape, which, in turn, influences its function. If a protein folds incorrectly, it may not work properly and could lead to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cystic fibrosis or diabetes.A protein’s overall shape depends on the tiny interactions, the attractions and repulsions, between all the atoms in the amino acids its made of. Some want to be together, some don’t. The protein twists and folds itself into a final shape based on many thousands of these chemical interactions.For decades, one of biology’s greatest challenges was predicting a protein’s shape based solely on its amino acid sequence. Although researchers can now predict the shape, we still don’t understand how the proteins maneuver into their specific shapes and minimize the repulsions of all the interatomic interactions in a few microseconds.To understand how proteins work and to prevent misfolding, scientists needed a way to predict the way proteins fold, but solving this puzzle was no easy task.In 2003, University of Washington biochemist David Baker wrote Rosetta, a computer program for designing proteins. With it, he showed it was possible to reverse the protein-folding problem by designing a protein shape and then predicting the amino acid sequence needed to create it.It was a phenomenal jump forward, but the shape chosen for the calculation was simple, and the calculations were complex. A major paradigm shift was required to routinely design novel proteins with desired structures.A New Era of Machine LearningMachine learning is a type of AI where computers learn to solve problems by analyzing vast amounts of data. It’s been used in various fields, from game-playing and speech recognition to autonomous vehicles and scientific research. The idea behind machine learning is to use hidden patterns in data to answer complex questions.This approach made a huge leap in 2010 when Demis Hassabis co-founded DeepMind, a company aiming to combine neuroscience with AI to solve real-world problems.Hassabis, a chess prodigy at age 4, quickly made headlines with AlphaZero, an AI that taught itself to play chess at a superhuman level. In 2017, AlphaZero thoroughly beat the world’s top computer chess program, Stockfish-8. The AI’s ability to learn from its own gameplay, rather than relying on preprogrammed strategies, marked a turning point in the AI world.Soon after, DeepMind applied similar techniques to Go, an ancient board game known for its immense complexity. In 2016, its AI program AlphaGodefeated one of the world’s top players, Lee Sedol, in a widely watched match that stunned millions.Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind on Oct. 9, 2024, after being awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

Under the leadership of John Jumper, a chemist with a background in protein science, the AlphaFold project began.

ROME (AP) — Italy is temporarily blocking the artificial intelligence software ChatGPT in the wake of a data breach as it investigates a possible violation of stringent European Union data protection rules, the government’s privacy watchdog said Friday.
The Italian Data Protection Authority said it was taking provisional action “until ChatGPT respects privacy,” including temporarily limiting the company from processing Italian users’ data. 
U.S.-based OpenAI, which developed the chatbot, said late Friday night it has disabled ChatGPT for Italian users at the government’s request. The company said it believes its practices comply with European privacy laws and hopes to make ChatGPT available again soon.
While some public schools and universities around the world have blocked ChatGPT from their local networks over student plagiarism concerns, Italy’s action is “the first nation-scale restriction of a mainstream AI platform by a democracy,” said Alp Toker, director of the advocacy group NetBlocks, which monitors internet access worldwide.
The restriction affects the web version of ChatGPT, popularly used as a writing assistant, but is unlikely to affect software applications from companies that already have licenses with OpenAI to use the same technology driving the chatbot, such as Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
The AI systems that power such chatbots, known as large language models, are able to mimic human writing styles based on the huge trove of digital books and online writings they have ingested.


  

The Italian watchdog said OpenAI must report within 20 days what measures it has taken to ensure the privacy of users’ data or face a fine of up to either 20 million euros (nearly $22 million) or 4% of annual global revenue.
The agency’s statement cites the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and pointed to a recent data breach involving ChatGPT “users’ conversations” and information about subscriber payments.
OpenAI earlier announced that it had to take ChatGPT offline on March 20 to fix a bug that allowed some people to see the titles, or subject lines, of other users’ chat history.
“Our investigation has also found that 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus users might have had personal data revealed to another user,” the company had said. “We believe the number of users whose data was actually revealed to someone else is extremely low and we have contacted those who might be impacted.”


  

Italy’s privacy watchdog, known as the Garante, also questioned whether OpenAI had legal justification for its “massive collection and processing of personal data” used to train the platform’s algorithms. And it said ChatGPT can sometimes generate — and store — false information about individuals.
Finally, it noted there’s no system to verify users’ ages, exposing children to responses “absolutely inappropriate to their age and awareness.”
OpenAI said in response that it works “to reduce personal data in training our AI systems like ChatGPT because we want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.” 
“We also believe that AI regulation is necessary — so we look forward to working closely with the Garante and educating them on how our systems are built and used,” the company said.


  

The Italian watchdog’s move comes as concerns grow about the artificial intelligence boom. A group of scientists and tech industry leaders published a letter Wednesday calling for companies such as OpenAI to pause the development of more powerful AI models until the fall to give time for society to weigh the risks.
The president of Italy’s privacy watchdog agency told Italian state TV Friday evening he was one of those who signed the appeal. Pasquale Stanzione said he did so because “it’s not clear what aims are being pursued” ultimately by those developing AI. 
If AI should “impinge” on a person’s “self-determination” then “this is very dangerous,” Stanzione said. He also described the absence of filters for users younger than 13 as ”rather grave.” 
San Francisco-based OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, announced this week that he’s embarking on a six-continent trip in May to talk about the technology with users and developers. That includes a stop planned for Brussels, where European Union lawmakers have been negotiating sweeping new rules to limit high-risk AI tools, as well as visits to Madrid, Munich, London and Paris.


  

European consumer group BEUC called Thursday for EU authorities and the bloc’s 27 member nations to investigate ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. BEUC said it could be years before the EU’s AI legislation takes effect, so authorities need to act faster to protect consumers from possible risks.
“In only a few months, we have seen a massive take-up of ChatGPT, and this is only the beginning,” Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl said. 
Waiting for the EU’s AI Act “is not good enough as there are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people.”

                  The Potential of Artificial Intelligence in Mixology


  

ByGabriel Botha
 
                      Aug 4, 2023
 
I recently used an artificial intelligence chatbot called ChatGPT to create a unique cocktail recipe. Despite not being physically on a North Carolina veranda, as I claimed, the chatbot provided a recipe suitable for that setting. Curious, I decided to give it a try.
The resulting cocktail, named the “Capote Cooler” after Truman Capote, turned out to be quite good. It began with a honey-tinged variation of the whiskey sour known as the Gold Rush, and then incorporated bitters and club soda to invigorate the flavors.
While Capote’s preferred cocktail was actually the screwdriver, I embraced ChatGPT’s suggestion for this particular experiment. To enhance the experience, I used Microsoft Bing’s Image Creator to simulate a classic Southern cocktail setting on a veranda in the Carolinas. The generated images depicted serene scenes with Spanish moss and gauzy hills, creating an ambiance that complemented the drink.
This experiment highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in mixology. By utilizing large language models and image creation tools, we can explore new culinary ideas and elevate our drinking experiences. It is an exciting prospect as we raise a glass to our new home bartender overlords, continually inspiring and surprising us with their creations.
Artificial intelligence opens up new possibilities in various fields, and mixology is no exception. With AI-driven assistance, both amateur and professional mixologists can expand their repertoire and create unique drink recipes that cater to different preferences and settings. It also encourages creativity and experimentation, pushing the boundaries of traditional mixology.
As technology continues to advance, we can anticipate even more innovative applications of artificial intelligence in the culinary world. So, let’s toast to a future where AI adds to the artistry of mixology, enhancing our enjoyment of cocktails in novel and unexpected ways.

The global strategic collaboration aims at understanding a bunch of mental disorders. 

Data from the Liber Institute comprised of 2,800 brain samples that encompassed psychiatric conditions like the bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. Vin Singh – the chief executive of Bullfrog AI said in a press release today:

This collaboration marks a pivotal moment in psychiatric research. We’ve gained invaluable ground into unraveling biological underpinning of psychiatric disorders.

The news arrives months after the Nasdaq-listed firm reported $1.25 million of net loss for its third financial quarter.

As part of that agreement, the nonprofit research centre based out of Baltimore, Maryland had agreed to offer Bullfrog an exclusive access to its brain data. CEO Vin Singh of the AI-assisted drug development company also said on Wednesday:

These findings have potential to pave the way for developing more targeted and effective treatments that set the stage to seek out revenue-generating partnerships with pharma companies.

Bullfrog AI has been a publicly listed company for almost a year now. It’s initial public offering (IPO) last year in February had raised about $8.4 million in total.

The ISO13485 certification is an important milestone in bringing the automated, high-throughput platform to market and the ability to develop affordable and scalable tools for omics-based precision medicine.
Lifespin GmbH, with headquarters in Regensburg and an office in Boston, MA, announced today that it has received ISO13485:2016 certification for its proprietary AI-based metabolomics technology platform in Regensburg.
“The ISO13485 certification is a very important milestone on the way to bringing our AI-based metabolomics platform for diagnostic applications to market,” said Dr. Ali Tinazli, CEO of Lifespin GmbH. “This move will support and enable our first commercial product launch, planned for this year, and other products to come to market thereafter.”
Lifespin is building a highly scalable, automated technology platform based on digitized metabolomic data for use in a variety of medical fields such as diagnostics, disease management and pharmaceutical research and development. Lifespin has built one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of metabolic health profiles of healthy and diseased individuals, spanning multiple age and sex groups and specific diseases in the fields of neurology, oncology and inflammation.
“Lifespin’s proprietary technology uniquely combines biology, deep data, artificial intelligence and cloud technologies and could open the door to digital metabolic analysis as the future gold standard to expand the field of precision diagnostics and create new diagnostic products that are still around today doesn’t exist,” says Dr. Ali Tinazli, CEO of Lifespin. “This could include products for diagnosing neurological disorders, as well as applications in therapy monitoring, for pharmaceutical research purposes, and in nutrition for the control of diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases.”

We are proud of the hard work and dedication of our team in achieving this milestone,” said Dr. Roland Geyer, COO of Lifespin.
The products and services offered by Lifespin to date are for Research Use Only (RUO) only and are not intended for use in diagnostics. Current developments in the areas of general health testing, oncology and neurology leading to the first regulated products in human diagnostics are expected in 2023.

Lifespin ( https://www.lifespin.health ) is a deep data company that maps human health through snapshots of metabolic state. Lifespin has standardized the Human Health Baseline to detect significant abnormalities in human metabolism caused by disease. Studies show that pathogenesis affects metabolism and causes specific changes in the presence and amount of metabolites. Lifespin is building its own biobank, which already includes more than 200,000 human blood samples. Lifespin’s proprietary diagnostic technology platform is capable of quantifying individual metabolic events, ie up to hundreds of metabolite concentrations, with a single nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement. Using its proprietary technology, Lifespin performs in-house quantitative measurements of metabolomes and digitizes metabolic profiles spanning billions of metabolic relationships. These digital metabolic profiles enable systematic mapping of various health conditions and will enable differential diagnosis and early detection of health conditions, disease staging, treatment outcome monitoring and personalized medicine. Tests to detect neurological, cancer and inflammatory diseases are in the pipeline, with first regulated products expected in 2023. Lifespin’s cloud-based business model is based on a proprietary software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for diagnostics and health information and is globally scalable. Lifespin’s Advisory Board consists of key opinion leaders such as James Rothman (Nobel Laureate in Physiology/Medicine, Sterling Professor of Cell Biology at Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA) and other prominent figures in the relevant fields.
